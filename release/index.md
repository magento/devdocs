Magento continually strives to find the right balance between making product upgrades simple and predictable and delivering improvements and new features to early adopters faster. Over the last year, we have refined how we deliver software to support this balance. For additional information, refer to our [release policy]({{site.baseurl}}/release/policy/).

## Availability

The following table describes the status of Magento software availability and where to get it, particularly for software that is available outside the conventional {{site.data.var.ee}} Composer package.

## Compatibility

Magento modules that have been built to be decoupled from the {{site.data.var.ee}} core release process; this allows us to release iterations of these modules faster to merchants who are willing to accept a little risk in exchange for earlier access to new features.

The following table shows the release status of Magento extension versions relative to {{site.data.var.ee}}.
