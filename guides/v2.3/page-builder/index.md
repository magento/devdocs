# What is Page Builder?

Page Builder is a Magento extension for creating content by dragging-and-dropping pre-built controls.Â 
We call these controls "content types." The available content types are shown in Page Builder's menu:

![Page Builder content types]({{ site.baseurl }}/page-builder/docs/images/pagebuilder-content-types.png){:width="615px" height="auto"}
