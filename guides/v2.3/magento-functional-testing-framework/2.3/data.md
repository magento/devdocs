Tests require data to function properly.

The MFTF allows you to specify and use `<data>` entities defined in XML. Default `<data>` entities are provided for use and as templates for entity creation and manipulation.

The following diagram shows the XML structure of an MFTF data object:

### Supply data to test by reference to a data entity
{%raw%}
Test steps requiring `<data>` input in an action, like filling a field with a string, may reference an attribute from a data entity:

```xml
userInput="{{SimpleSubCategory.name}}"
```

In this example:

* `SimpleSubCategory` is an entity name.
* `name` is a `<data>` key of the entity. The corresponding value will be assigned to `userInput` as a result.

****
#### Environmental data

```xml
userInput="{{_ENV.MAGENTO_ADMIN_USERNAME}}"
```

In this example:

* `_ENV` is a reference to the `dev/tests/acceptance/.env` file, where basic environment variables are set.
* `MAGENTO_ADMIN_USERNAME` is a name of an environment variable.
The corresponding value will be assigned to `userInput` as a result.

#### Sensitive data

```xml
userInput="{{_CREDS.MY_SECRET_TOKEN}}"
```

In this example:

* `_CREDS` is a reference to the `dev/tests/acceptance/.credentials` file, where sensitive data and secrets are stored for use in a test.
* `MY_SECRET_TOKEN` is the name of a key in the credentials variable.
The corresponding value of the credential will be assigned to `userInput` as a result.
* Credential values are not generated into a test. Instead, they are dynamically retrieved, encrypted and decrypted when used by a specific action during the test's execution.
* References to credentials do not appear decrypted in the console, error logs or test reports, their values can only be seen decrypted in the .credentials file in which they are stored.

### Persist a data entity as a prerequisite of a test

A test can specify an entity to be persisted (created in the database) so that the test actions could operate on the existing known data.

Example of referencing `data` in a test:

```xml
userInput="$createCustomer.email$"
```

{%endraw%}
In this example:

* `createCustomer` is a `stepKey` of the corresponding test step that creates an entity.
* `email` is a `dataKey` of the entity.
The corresponding value will be assigned to `userInput` as a result.

{%
include note.html
type="info"
content='As of MFTF 2.3.6, you no longer need to differentiate between scopes (a test, a hook, or a suite) for persisted data when referencing it in tests.

The MFTF now stores the persisted data and attempts to retrieve it using the combination of `stepKey` and the scope of where it has been called.
The current scope is prefered, then widening to _test > hook > suite_ or _hook > test > suite_.

This emphasizes the practice for the `stepKey` of `createData` to be descriptive and unique, as a duplicated `stepKey` in both a `<test>` and `<before>` prefers the `<test>` data.'
%}

### Use data returned by test actions
{%raw%}
A test can also reference data that was returned as a result of [test actions](./test/actions.html#actions-returning-a-variable), like the action `<grabValueFrom selector="someSelector" stepKey="grabStepKey>`.

Further in the test, the data grabbed by the `someSelector` selector can be referenced using the `stepKey` value. In this case, it is `grabStepKey`.

The following example shows the usage of `grabValueFrom` in testing, where the returned value is used by action's `stepKey`:

```xml
<grabValueFrom selector="someSelector" stepKey="grabStepKey"/>
<fillField selector=".functionalTestSelector" userInput="{$grabStepKey}" stepKey="fillFieldKey1"/>
```

### Hard-coded data input

The data to operate against can be included as literals in a test. Hard-coded data input can be useful in assertions.

See also [Actions](./test/actions.html).

```xml
userInput="We'll email you an order confirmation with details and tracking info."
```

## Format

The format of `<data>` is:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<entities xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:mftf:DataGenerator/etc/dataProfileSchema.xsd">
    <entity name="" type="">
        <data key=""></data>
    </entity>
    <entity name="" type="">
        <data key="" unique=""></data>
        <var key="" entityType="" entityKey=""/>
    </entity>
</entities>
```

## Principles

The following conventions apply to MFTF `<data>`:

* A `<data>` file may contain multiple data entities.
* Camel case is used for `<data>` elements. The name represents the `<data>` type. For example, a file with customer data is `CustomerData.xml`. A file for simple product would be `SimpleProductData.xml`.
* Camel case is used for the entity name.

## Example

Example (`.../Catalog/Data/CategoryData.xml` file):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<entities xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:mftf:DataGenerator/etc/dataProfileSchema.xsd">
    <entity name="_defaultCategory" type="category">
        <data key="name" unique="suffix">simpleCategory</data>
        <data key="name_lwr" unique="suffix">simplecategory</data>
        <data key="is_active">true</data>
    </entity>
    <entity name="SimpleSubCategory" type="category">
        <data key="name" unique="suffix">SimpleSubCategory</data>
        <data key="name_lwr" unique="suffix">simplesubcategory</data>
        <data key="is_active">true</data>
        <data key="include_in_menu">true</data>
    </entity>
</entities>
```

This example declares two `<data>` entities: `_defaultCategory` and `SimpleSubCategory`. They set the data required for [category creation](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/catalog/category-create.html).

All entities that have the same name will be merged during test generation. Both entities are of the `category` type.

`_defaultCategory` sets three data fields:

* `name` defines the category name as `simpleCategory` with a unique suffix. Example: `simpleCategory598742365`.
* `name_lwr` defines the category name in lowercase format with a unique suffix. Example: `simplecategory697543215`.
* `is_active` sets the enable category to `true`.

`SimpleSubCategory` sets four data fields:

* `name` that defines the category name with a unique suffix. Example: `SimpleSubCategory458712365`.
* `name_lwr` that defines the category name in lowercase format with a unique suffix. Example: `simplesubcategory753698741`.
* `is_active` sets the enable category to `true`.
* `include_in_menu` that sets the include in the menu to `true`.

The following is an example of a call in test:

```xml
<fillField selector="{{AdminCategoryBasicFieldSection.categoryNameInput}}" userInput="{{_defaultCategory.name}}" stepKey="enterCategoryName"/>
```

This action inputs data from the `name` of the `_defaultCategory` entity (for example, `simpleCategory598742365`) into the field with the locator defined in the selector of the `categoryNameInput` element of the `AdminCategoryBasicFieldSection`.

## Reference

### entities {#entities-tag}

`<entities>` is an element that contains all `<entity>`  elements.

### entity {#entity-tag}

`<entity>` is an element that contains `<data>` elements.

Attributes|Type|Use|Description
---|---|---|---
`name`|string|optional|Name of the `<entity>`.
`type`|string|optional|Node containing the exact name of `<entity>` type. Used later to find specific Persistence Layer Model class. `type` in `<data>` can be whatever the user wants; There are no constraints. It is important when persisting data, depending on the `type` given, as it will try to match a metadata definition with the operation being done. Example: A `myCustomer` entity with `type="customer"`, calling `<createData entity="myCustomer"/>`, will try to find a metadata entry with the following attributes: `<operation dataType="customer" type="create">`.

`<entity>` may contain one or more [`<data>`](#data-tag), [`<var>`](#var-tag), [`<required-entities>`](#requiredentities-tag), or [`<array>`](#array-tag) elements in any sequence.

### data {#data-tag}

`<data>` is an element containing a data/value pair.

Attributes|Type|Use|Description
---|---|---|---
`key`|string|optional|Key attribute of data/value pair.
`unique`|enum: `"prefix"`, `"suffix"`|optional|Add suite or test wide unique sequence as "prefix" or "suffix" to the data value if specified.

### var {#var-tag}

`<var>` is an element that can be used to grab a key value from another entity. For example, when creating a customer with the `<createData>` action, the server responds with the auto-incremented ID of that customer. Use `<var>` to access that ID and use it in another data entity.

Attributes|Type|Use|Description
---|---|---|---
`key`|string|optional|Key attribute of this entity to assign a value to.
`entityType`|string|optional|Type attribute of referenced entity.
`entityKey`|string|optional|Key attribute of the referenced entity from which to get a value.
`unique`|--|--|*This attribute hasn't been implemented yet.*

### requiredEntity {#requiredentity-tag}

`<requiredEntity>` is an element that specifies the parent/child relationship between complex types.

Example: You have customer address info. To specify that relationship:

```xml
<entity name="CustomerEntity" type="customer">
    ...
    <requiredEntity type="address">AddressEntity</requiredEntity>
    ...
</entity>
```

Attributes|Type|Use|Description
---|---|---|---
`type`|string|optional|Type attribute of `<requiredEntity>`.

### array {#array-tag}

`<array>` is an element that contains a reference to an array of values.

Example:

```xml
<entity name="AddressEntity" type="address">
    ...
    <array key="street">
        <item>7700 W Parmer Ln</item>
        <item>Bld D</item>
    </array>
    ...
</entity>
```

Attributes|Type|Use|Description
---|---|---|---
`key`|string|required|Key attribute of this entity in which to assign a value.

`<array>` may contain [`<item>`](#item-tag) elements.

### item {#item-tag}

`<item>` is an individual piece of data to be passed in as part of the parent `<array>` type.
