*Release notes published October 25, 2018.*


We are pleased to present Magento Commerce 2.3.0 Beta. This release includes numerous functional fixes and enhancements. Note that Magento 2.3.0 pre-release code is a work in progress.

For information about signing up for the Magento 2.3 Beta Evaluation program, see [Magento 2.3.0 Beta Quick Start Guide]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/2.3.0-quick-start.html). 

## About Magento 2.3.0 Beta release

We welcome all feedback from registered participants on this Beta release. 

## Highlights

Magento Commerce 2.3.0 includes a wealth of new features as well as hundreds of enhancements and fixes to the core product. Look for the following highlights in this release:

### New features

This release introduces significant tools to improve the developer experience: PWA Studio, alternatives to SOAP and REST, and a flexible frontend  API for frontend, headless, and mobile development.

* **PageBuilder** is a drag-and-drop visual content editing tool that lets merchants customize the appearance of their storefront without writing any HTML or CSS. PageBuilder Beta code will be available in 2018 Q4. Registered participants will be able to install PageBuilder Beta on Magento 2.3.0 Commerce code.  Watch this space for more information about participating in the PageBuilder Beta program plus installation instructions. 


* **PWA Studio** is a set of tools that support the development, deployment and maintenance of progressive web applications. See [Magento PWA documentation](https://magento-research.github.io/pwa-studio/) for information about this toolset as well as information about contributing to this ongoing project.  


* **Declarative schema** simplifies installation and upgrade procedures for Magento and extensions. Declarative schema reduce the need for many database scripts, eliminating the need to maintain these scripts. And here's a big advantage: This features enables Magento to roll out database schema changes in patch releases (not currently possible). This feature supports split and shared database structures and database structure validation. 


* **GraphQL API** provides an alternative to REST and SOAP web APIs for frontend development. See [GraphQL Developer Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/v2.3/graphql/index.html) for more information about Magento's implementation of this data query language. 


* **MultiSource Inventory (MSI)** lets merchants manage physical inventory across locations in Magento. Merchants can represent multiple locations (sources) for physical inventory in Magento. Sources can be grouped into stocks to create inventory pools that can be defined for one or more websites. Merchants can manipulate inventory based on sources. Magento also provides an API for source operations that helps merchants customize inventory actions or third-party order management systems to perform the same actions in an automated way. 

### Core product improvements

* **Updates to Magento's tech stack (including upgraded PHP support)** include upgrades to Redis, MySQL, Elasticsearch, compatibility with PHP 7.2. 

* **Improvements to import and export**  focus on enhancements to existing processes, including the  addition of new object types. 

* **Elasticsearch support for Magento Community version**. Elasticsearch support was previously provided in Magento Commerce only. 

* **Improvements to release packaging** plus an increase in test automation, results in a faster, more efficient release process and improved product quality. 

* **CMS enhancements** include banner enhancements. You can now create banner content in native Magento WYSIWYG or Page Builder. (Within the product interface, we now use the term  “dynamic block” instead of  “banner”.) We've also updated the WYSIWYG editor to use TinyMCE 4.6. (TinyMCE is now integrated into Magento through an adapter that allows it to be replaced with any other WYSIWYG editor.) 

* **Security enhancements** 

    * Cache flush ACL provides granular access to cache management settings to prevent accidental changes that could potentially affect system performance. This ACL also lets merchants control which administrative users can clear site caches. 

    * 2FA/CAPTCHA protects the Admin panel against against stolen passwords and protects stores against bots.

* **Change in versioning for B2B product** to match the versioning of the core product. 

## Known issues

Magento 2.3.0 pre-release code is a work in progress, and readiness of different components may vary. See [Component Status]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/component-status.html) for an overview of the health of core code components and modules.

### Issues fixed in 2.3.0 Alpha

The following issues, which were identified in our 2.3.0 Alpha code base, have been fixed in this Beta release:

#### AdminGWS

<!--- 91565 -->*  Restricted Admin users can now successfully create and save product attributes.

<!--- 91616 -->*  Restricted Admins can now create and edit CMS blocks as expected. Previously, Magento displayed this error message when a administrator with restricted privileges tries to create a new CMS block: `Warning: array_intersect(): Argument #1 is not an array in /var/www/html/magento2ee/app/code/Magento/AdminGws/Model/Models.php on line 1075`.


#### Application framework

<!--- 93723,  92185-->* The Magento application framework has been updated to address a jQuery security issue.



#### B2B

<!--- 91697 -->* Tier prices for already added products no longer change when a merchant adds additional products to an order from the Admin. Previously, the tier price of products in an order changed when the merchant added more products to the order, applied  a custom price to one of the products, or when applied a coupon code to the order.


<!--- 91648 -->* Merchants can now create a company for which the region or state is not required. Previously, Magento did not create this company, and displayed this error, `Invalid value of "" provided for the region_id field`. 




#### Cart



<!--- 60846 -->* Magento now alerts customers when a previously applied gift card has been removed during checkout. 


#### Cart Price rules

<!--- 94407 -->*  The cart price rule now uses specified conditions correctly when applying discounts on configurable products. 



#### Catalog

<!--- 91575 -->*  Magento now correctly renders print previews of product compare pages. Previously, the print view did not display text from the right side of the product compare page. 

<!--- 91848 -->*  The validation hint on the product custom option page  text field now updates as expected with the number of characters left before hitting the maximum.


<!--- 91837 -->* The `PUT /V1/products/:sku/media/:entryId` call updates a product's media gallery as expected.


<!--- 91743 -->* Products no longer disappear from the Admin Product grid  after you delete its active schedule update.
 ee only

<!--- 91689 -->* Single quotation marks in attribute values are no longer  auto-converted to HTML when saved. 


<!--- 91608 -->* The SEO-friendly URL for category pages now works as expected. 

<!--- 45950 -->*  We've optimized queries on loading product attributes when store scope is used.

<!--- 91497 -->*  Products are no longer automatically assigned to websites based on store scope. If a product is assigned to one website only, that relationship is maintained even after the product is saved from the Admin. 


<!--- 91595 -->* Product Display Pages (PDPs) now load as expected when a product name contains a double quotation mark. 
Previously, Magento did not load the image if its name contained double quotation marks.

<!--- 91529 -->* A restricted Admin user who is authorized to access only designated websites can no longer remove products from undesignated websites. 


<!--- 91504 -->* Customers viewing a storefront on a mobile device  can now see the text displayed when clicking on the "More Information" accordion anchor without having to scroll back up. Previously, the Mobile PDP accordion widget did not work as expected on mobile devices. 



<!--- 91473 -->* Magento now maintains designated sort order for products after saving a product in a category. Previously, product sort order reverted to sorting by product ID.

<!--- 91450 -->* You can now filter successfully by date from the Admin on products in multistore environments. Previously, values in the product creation date field (that is, the date set when **Set Product as New from Date** is selected)  were arbitrarily changed, and filtering did not work. 

<!--- 91440 -->*  Attributes with no assigned values on a product are no longer displayed with a  value of N/A in the Compare Products page or block as expected. 



<!--- 91439 -->* Prices are now visible as expected on the category page for a configurable product when you re-enable them from the Admin. Previously, when you re-enabled a previously disabled product and assigned it to a different store, Magento did not display its price on the category or product page. 



<!--- 91435 -->* Category smart rules now work as expected for partial values when conditions include using a dropdown attribute and "contains”.


<!--- 91434 -->* Magento now correctly sets the default option for the `status` attribute when a merchant creates a product. Previously, Magento changed a default setting of disabled (**No**) to **Yes** during product creation.


<!--- 69949 -->* `auto_increment` values are now preserved after restarting the MySQL server.


<!--- 91436 -->* You can now successfully save a product with custom options to a different website in multisite deployments. Previously, when you added another site to a product with customizable options, Magento corrupted these options. by splitting into multiple options or duplicating an option.


<!--- 62310 -->* A product’s **Use Default Value** check box for attributes is now unchecked by default when you add a new website to a product’s scope.







#### Checkout

<!--- 91734 -->*   Guest orders placed with gift cards can now be canceled as expected.

<!--- 91624 -->*  Braintree now permits customers to change the billing addresses on orders when paying with a saved card. Previously, Braintree used the same address for both billing and shipping. 


<!--- 91465 -->*  Customers can now change an existing  value in the checkout page’s  **State/Province** field to an alphanumeric value. Previously, when a customer tried to edit this field in this way, Magento did not place the order, and displayed a descriptive error message. 



<!--- 90971 -->*  Magento now successfully processes an order that contains products that will be shipped to multiple shipping addresses. Previously, Magento did not complete the order, but displayed an error message. 



<!--- 62891 -->*  Magento now saves the address that a customer enters during checkout if the customer selects **Save in address book**.  Previously, Magento saved the address, but left the default billing address field empty.





#### Configurable product


<!--- 77744 -->* Magento now displays a helpful error when  a merchant attempts to upload a file in an unsupported file format. 


<!--- 8709 -->* The wishlist now displays the appropriate product image for configurable products with selected options. Previously, Magento displayed the parent image instead of the image of the selected child product.
https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8168



#### Custom attributes

<!--- 93754 -->*  Merchants can now create attributes  for customer addresses (**Stores** > **Attributes** > **Customer Address**) as expected. Previously, a merchant could create an attribute, but Magento did not save or display it. 




#### Customer custom attributes

<!--- 91519 -->*  Magento now adds the address entered during checkout to a new account when a custom address attribute is required when creating a user account after checkout. 


<!--- 91509 -->*  User-defined customer attributes are now copied to the `magento_customercustomattributes_sales_flat_order` table after placing an order as expected. 


#### Customers

<!--- 94406 -->*  Magento now loads customer private data only once when system state changes. Previously, "Directory Data" and "Cart" were loaded twice after a user logged in to the system, which caused additional server load and traffic.


<!--- 91760 -->*  Magento now correctly displays both the default and additional shipping addresses  provided during checkout.
Previously, Magento displayed attributes with dropdown and multiple select types with incorrect values (option IDs instead of labels) for shipping addresses on checkout.


#### EAV


<!--- 91580 -->* Magento no longer displays empty product attributes of dropdown or swatch type as having a value of **no** on the storefront. 


<!--- 91570 -->* Magento now displays an error message as expected when  it does not save dropdown values as you create them. Previously, Magento did not save the options, but did not alert you in a message. 


#### General

<!--- 91762 -->* Magento now processes the oldest message queue entries first instead of last.

<!--- 67627 -->* You can successfully save a CMS page with same URL key as another store on a different website but with the same hierarchy. 

<!--- 66489 -->* You can now successfully preview a Registry Update email template. Previously, Magento threw a fatal error when you tried to preview this template. 


<!--- 64854 -->* Enterprise Rewards no longer permit double refunds. Previously, problems with the refund logic permitted the inadvertent creation of a double refund. 


<!--- 59789 -->* Swatch images now resize as expected. Previously, even when a product attribute with Catalog Input Type for Store Owner was set to **Visual swatch**, the image size did not adjust as expected. 




#### Import/Export

<!--- 91594 -->* Import now completes successfully when a product’s CSV entry is split over two import “bunches”.  Previously, Magento threw this error, `Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails`, and import failed. 

<!--- 87974 -->* You can now hide an image as expected by using the `hide_from_product_page` attribute during import.





#### Infrastructure


<!--- 93039 -->Note: Several components included by Composer have been updated to the latest patch versions. 

<!--- 68802 -->* Customers can change product status by clicking on the toggle element or by clicking on label text, but not by clicking the area around a toggle element. Previously, if a customer  clicked on the area around a toggle element, Magento changed the state of the element. Unintended results could occur if a customer mistakenly clicked on the area around the element and didn't realize that the status had  changed.



#### Newsletters

<!--- 91701 -->* A customer subscription on one store no longer depends on  the customer’s subscription on another store.



#### Payments

<!--- 94402 -->* The **Billing Address** field now displays the designated billing address as expected  for a registered customer  when checking out with Paypal Express Checkout. Previously, Magento displayed the shipping address in the **Billing Address** field in both the order confirmation email and the Admin.


<!--- 91500 -->* Admin users that are not part of the Administrator group can now complete payment for an order using Braintree.


#### Reports 

<!--- 63173 -->* Wishlist reports are available on the Admin as expected. 


#### Return Merchandise Authorizations (RMA)

`GET  V1/returns/:id` calls return tracks objects as expected.  



#### Sales

<!--- 91710 -->* The grand total for a credit memo now matches the invoiced total when a discount is applied to shipping charges.

<!--- 59632 -->* The Items Ordered list now updates as expected when the user clicks **OK** when changing the options of a configurable product during creation of an order from the Admin. Previously, the update did not occur until the user clicked **Update Items and Quantities**.

<!--- 91678 -->*  Admin orders are no longer restricted by a minimum order amount. Previously, Magento required this minimum for both Admin and storefront users. 

<!--- 70661 -->* Orders exported to a CSV file now display dates in a consistent format. 



#### Search

<!--- 93994 -->*  Elasticsearch is now the default search engine in Magento. MySQL search has been deprecated. 

<!--- 91625 -->*  Elasticsearch now works as expected in Chinese locales. 

<!--- 59305 -->*  Elasticsearch no longer includes out-of-stock product options in search results. 



#### Shipping

<!--- 94433 -->*  The Magento UPS module has been updated to support new UPS API endpoints.

<!--- 59529 -->*  You can now use `GET .V1/shipments` to search for shipments that contain a shipping label. Previously, using this call  caused Magento to throw an exception. [GitHub-6668](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/6668)



#### Web API framework

<!--- 64316 -->*  When you create a product with `POST V1/products` whose name matches an existing product, Magento changes the URL key of the new product to a unique value. This matches the behavior when you create a product in Admin. [GitHub-8188](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8188)


<!--- 91540 -->*  Product searches using `GET V1/products` return extension_attributes for configurable products as expected.

<!--- 91568 -->*  You can now include custom attributes when filtering the responses of REST calls.

<!--- 94207 -->*  Magento now returns a 404 error and includes a descriptive error message when a  REST search is performed on a non-existent cart.

<!--- 81992-->* You can now use the `bin/magento cron:install`  and `cron:remove` commands to install or uninstall cron across multiple Magento installations with the same crontab. Previously, you could not create different crontab entries for multiple Magento installations that were in different folders because they used the same `#~ MAGENTO START` and `#~ MAGENTO END` suffixes. *Fix submitted by [adrian-martinez-interactiv4](https://github.com/adrian-martinez-interactiv4) in pull request 11360*.

[GitHub-10032](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10032)


<!---71359 -->* All `cron` schedule times are now saved in UTC and then displayed to the user in the expected time zone. Previously, the `cron` schedule times in the database were in local date time formats and not UTC, while the other system dates and times were saved as UTC in the database. This resulted in varying and potentially confusing *Fix submitted by [Anton Evers](https://github.com/ajpevers) in pull request 10432*. [GitHub-4237](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/4237)

### Cart and checkout

<!--- 71761-->* You can now delete the last product in your shopping cart even when the **Minimum Order Amount** setting (**Admin > Sales**) is enabled. Previously, if you tried to delete the last item in your cart under these circumstances, Magento would throw an exception. *Fix submitted by [Anton Evers](https://github.com/ajpevers) in pull request 10601* [GitHub-6151](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/6151)

<!--- 85016-->* You can now add a new product with custom attributes that has the same name and attributes as a previously deleted product. Previously, Magento did not let you add this new product because a `request_path` with the same value already existed in `table url_rewrite` from the previous product. *Fix submitted by [Nickolas Malyovanets](https://github.com/nmalevanec) in pull request 12538*. [GitHub-12110](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12110)

<!---83065 -->* Magento now saves the assigned background color for images correctly.

<!---85617 -->* Magento no longer throws an exception when you add a product with a tiered price reduced to $0.00 to your shopping cart. 

### Configurable products

<!--- 85177 -->* Magento now displays the price of a configurable product as expected even when its simple products are out-of-stock. Previously, Magento displayed a price of 0 for any configurable product price when its simple products were out-of-stock. [GitHub-12578](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12578)

<!--- 70491 -->*  Magento now displays the correct price of product when its special-price option has not been selected.

[GitHub-6457](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/6457)

<!--- 70491 -->* Configurable product prices now correctly reflect VAT amounts as set by tax rule settings.

Previously, The `afterLoad()` method was evoked only after loading the configuration value from the database, and not after loading the configuration from `config.xml`. This caused the default configuration from `config.xml` to be passed to the form-element as `string` instead of `Array`, which resulted in empty configuration fields in the Admin. *Fix submitted by [kweij](https://github.com/kweij) in pull request 7742*.

[GitHub-10527](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10527)

<!--- 71544, 71539-->* Google Analytics has improved support of websites that conduct transactions in multiple currencies.

<!--- 72863-->* Searching for a value of an attribute set on the store-view level of a product now returns results. Previously, Magento returned results  only if the attribute value was entered on the all store-view levels.
