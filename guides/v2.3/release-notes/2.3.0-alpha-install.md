## Install 2.3.0 Alpha

1. Install the Open Source or Commerce Alpha package.

   **Open Source**
   
   Available to everyone with Magento authentication keys. If you do not have authentication keys, complete the instructions in [Get your authentication keys]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html) before continuing.
   ```bash
   composer create-project --repository=https://repo.magento.com/ magento/project-community-edition=2.3.* --stability=alpha <install-directory-name>
   ```

   **Commerce**
   
   Only available to Magento partners, merchant developers, and independent extension developers who have signed [Magento's Pre-Release Software Agreement](https://partners.magento.com/portal/pre-release-agreement) and been approved to access the Commerce 2.3.0 Alpha repositories. If you have not signed the pre-release software agreement and been granted access, you must do so before continuing.
   ```bash
   composer create-project --repository=https://repo.magento.com/ magento/project-enterprise-edition=2.3.* --stability=alpha <install-directory-name>
   ```

   When prompted, enter your authentication keys. Your *public key* is your username; your *private key* is your password.

   If you encounter errors, such as `Could not find package...` or `...no matching package found`, make sure there aren't any typos in your command. If you still encounter errors, you may not have access to our pre-release Composer repositories. Contact [Magento support](https://magento.com/support) for help.
   </div> 

2. Set file permissions as follows:
    ```terminal
    cd /var/www/html/<magento install directory>
    find var generated vendor pub/static pub/media app/etc -type f -exec chmod g+w {} \;
    find var generated vendor pub/static pub/media app/etc -type d -exec chmod g+ws {} \;
    chown -R :www-data . // Ubuntu
    chmod u+x bin/magento
    ```
    
     For more information, refer to [Set file system ownership and permissions]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/prereq/file-system-perms.html).

3. Install Magento using the CLI or the Web Setup Wizard.

    **Using the CLI.** This example assumes that the Magento install directory is named `magento2ee`, the `db-host` is on the same machine (`localhost`), and that the `db-name`, `db-user`, and `db-password` are all `magneto`:
    
    ```bash
    bin/magento setup:install --base-url=http://localhost/magento2ee --db-host=localhost --db-name=magento --db-user=magento --db-password=magento --backend-frontname=admin --admin-firstname=admin --admin-lastname=admin --admin-email=admin@admin.com --admin-user=admin --admin-password=admin123 --language=en_US --currency=USD --timezone=America/Chicago --use-rewrites=1
    ```
    For a full description of the CLI install options, refer to [Install the Magento software from the command line]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/v2.3/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-install.html#instgde-install-cli-magento).
    
    **Using the Web Setup Wizard.** As an alternative to the CLI, use your browser to navigate to Magento's setup wizard:

    ```
    http://<Magento-host-or-IP>/<path-to-magento-root>/setup
    ```
    For example: `http://localhost/magento2ee/setup`

4. Install sample data (optional):

    ```bash
    bin/magento sampledata:deploy
    ```
    When prompted, enter your authentication keys. Your *public key* is your username; your *private key* is your password.
