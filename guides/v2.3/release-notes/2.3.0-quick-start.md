This guide covers:

* **Welcome to the Magento 2.3.0 Beta program and its requirements**

* **Install the Beta code**. See [2.3.0 Installation Guide]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/2.3.0-install.html) for complete instructions for downloading and installing Beta code.

* **Submit comments on Magento 2.3.0 Beta code** on [GitHub](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues)

* **Readiness status of individual code components**. Magento 2.3.0 pre-release code is a work in progress. Consequently, parts of the code base are more mature than others. You can see an overview of component status at [Component Status]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/component-status.html). Note that we will update this information weekly during the Release evaluation period.

PageBuilder Beta code will be available in 2018 Q4. Registered participants will be able to install PageBuilder Beta on Magento 2.3.0 Commerce code.  Watch this space for more information about participating in the PageBuilder Beta program plus installation instructions. 


## Welcome to the Magento 2.3.0 Beta code

Magento 2.3.0 Beta code will include bugs and incomplete features. It provides a snapshot of the current 2.3.0 codebase, and consequently an early peek into the new features that 2.3.0 will provide in more robust form.


Note: We will publish new Beta code weekly.

### What has changed since Alpha?

* Many bugs present in the last release of Alpha code (and identified as customer escalations)  have been fixed.

* Beta code is up-to-date with the latest security release (2.2.6).

* Beta code  includes all bundled extensions. 


### Magento goals for this Beta release

Our primary goal for this release is to invite and receive community and partner feedback that will help us refine our 2.3.0 product code before General Availability (GA). We have specific points of focus for Beta participants. 



#### General focal point

We hope that participants in this Beta evaluation can report on:

* **Functionality**. Keep in mind that pre-release code does not contain all the functionality that the 2.3.0 GA release will include.

* **Usability**. How do the features we've implemented for pre-GA code work in context of your typical workflows?

* **Code quality issues**. Are there particularly challenging processes or tasks that need improvement?

* **Feature gaps and enhancements**. Can you identify any steps within existing features that are missing, or enhancements that would improve features?


#### Focus for Beta code evaluation 

Although we welcome your comments on any product feature, for Beta we’d especially appreciate comments on the following tasks: 

* Upgrade or install Beta code using [Declarative Schema](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/extension-dev-guide/declarative-schema/index.html) rather than typical installation scripts. 

* Use [GraphQL](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/graphql/) for routine  operations such as queries for products.  

* Create and update products and customers using [bulk endpoints](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/rest/bulk-endpoints.html)  and [asynchronous web endpoints](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/rest/asynchronous-web-endpoints.html). 

### Participant goals

As community members and Partners, you have much to gain from participating in this release, too. Early access to this code provides you with the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the code and start training technical team members. Likewise, you can start planning  extension and custom code updates.

Beta phase provides merchants and developers an opportunity to:

* Test extensions and upgrade them to confirm that they work with new Magento version and PHP 7.2. Marketplace will provide a process for accepting updated extensions and will launch shortly before the GA release.

* Consider factors that affect upgrade in your particular environment. 


### Usage guidelines

Keep in mind the following features of this pre-GA code during your evaluation:

* Code released before General Availability is not production quality and will contain bugs. Report these bugs as GitHub issues, please!

* Code released before General Availability is for testing and training only. Do not use this code for production deployments. Any sites developed with Beta software will require significant reworking to accommodate future code updates.

* No technical support is available for problems you encounter during this evaluation.

### Participants

The {{site.data.var.ce}} 2.3.0 Beta Composer package is available to everyone. For access to the {{site.data.var.ee}} 2.3.0 Beta Composer package, contact [Magento Support](https://magento.com/support).

Do not share Beta code with anyone external to your organization.


### What will change between Beta and Magento 2.3.0 General Availability?

We anticipate the following changes to the 2.3.0 Beta code:

* Fixes for bugs found during our internal regression testing 

* Continued updates to product security.
