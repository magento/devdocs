title: Magento Open Source 2.3.2 Release Notes
---

*Patch code and release notes published on June 25, 2019.*

We are pleased to present Magento Open Source 2.3.2.  This release includes over 200 functional fixes to the core product, over 350 pull requests contributed by the community, and  over 75 security enhancements. It includes significant contributions from our community members.

## Other release information

Although code for these features is bundled with quarterly releases of the Magento core code, several of these projects (for example, Page Builder, Inventory Management, and Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Studio) are also released independently. Bug fixes for these projects are documented in separate, project-specific release information which is available in the documentation for each project.

## New security-only patch available

Merchants can now install time-sensitive security fixes without applying the hundreds of functional fixes and enhancements that a full quarterly release (for example, Magento 2.3.3) provides. Patch 2.3.2.2 (Composer package 2.3.2-p2) is a security-only patch that provides fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in our previous quarterly release, Magento 2.3.2.

**If you have already upgraded to the pre-release version of this patch (2.3.2-p1), we strongly recommend that you upgrade to 2.3.2-p2 as soon as possible.**  Patch 2.3.2-p2 contains the critical security fixes that are included in Magento  2.3.3, 2.2.10, 1.9.4.3, and 1.14.4.3, but that are not included in patch 2.3.2-p1.

For general information about security-only patches, see the Magento DevBlog post [Introducing the New Security-only Patch Release](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Introducing-the-New-Security-only-Patch-Release/ba-p/141287). For instructions on downloading and applying security-only patches (including patch 2.3.2-p1), see [Install Magento using Composer](https://devdocs-beta.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/composer.html#get-the-metapackage).

## Apply patch PRODSECBUG-2233 to address critical remote code execution vulnerability (RCE)

An unauthenticated cross-site scripting vulnerability combined with an authenticated Phar deserialization vulnerability has left this version of Magento Open Source open to serious exploit. An attacker can use these vulnerabilities to inject JavaScript into the Magento Admin, and subsequently launch malicious code in a store user’s browser.  **We strongly recommend that all users of the affected versions of Magento download and apply the appropriate patch as soon as possible**. This issue is discussed in the xxx blog post. Patches are available from the [Magento Download](https://magento.com/tech-resources/download) page. Locate the patch by the name. We provide Git-based and Composer-based patches.

## Apply the Scope parameter for Async/Bulk API patch to address an issue with the Async/Bulk REST API

In certain versions of Magento Open Source and Magento Commerce, the Asynchronous and Bulk REST endpoints support the default store view scope only. After this patch is applied to deployments running those versions of Magento, the current Magento message queue implementation
will factor in the store that executes queue operations. See [Patch for Magento Framework Message Queue and Store Scopes](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Patch-for-Magento-Framework-Message-Queue-and-Store-Scopes/ba-p/135209) for a full discussion of this scope-related issue and patch contents. See [Applying patches]({{ page.baseurl }}/comp-mgr/patching.html) for specific instructions on downloading and applying Magento patches. Navigate to the [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches), and select the patch associated with the version of Magento you are running.

## Highlights

Look for the following highlights in this release:

### Substantial security enhancements

This release is focused on substantial security enhancements:

*  **75 security enhancements** that help close cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution (RCE), and sensitive data disclosure vulnerabilities as well as other security issues. No confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. See [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-2.3.2-2.2.9-and-2.1.18-security-update) for a comprehensive discussion of these issues. All known exploitable security issues fixed in this release (2.3.2) have been ported to 2.2.9, 2.1.18, 1.14.4.2, and 1.9.4.2, as appropriate.

*  **Google reCAPTCHA module for PayPal Payflow checkout**. The new PaypalRecaptcha module adds Google reCAPTCHA and CAPTCHA to the Payflow Pro checkout form.  This enhanced functionality has been added in response to malicious targeting of Magento deployments that implement Payflow Pro. Configuration information can be found in [Google reCAPTCHA](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/stores/security-google-recaptcha.html).  <!--- MC-15427-->

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-note}
Starting with the release of Magento Commerce 2.3.2, Magento will  assign and publish indexed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers with each security bug reported to us by external parties. This  will allows users of Magento Commerce to more easily identify unaddressed vulnerabilities in their deployment.

### Performance boosts

*  **Significant improvement to storefront page response time**. The page response times for the catalog, search, and advanced search pages have been significantly improved under high load. <!--- MAGETWO-95294--->

*  **Improved concurrent access to block cache storage**. We have optimized the logic of concurrent access to the block cache, which  has improved the response of storefront pages under high load by approximately 20%.  <!--- MC-6273-->

*  **Product page gallery load optimization**.  Product images are now loaded as quickly as other page content. In previous releases, although the product page loaded quickly, product images needed two to four additional seconds to load completely. <!--- MC-15440-->

*  **Improved page rendering through deferred loading and parsing of storefront JavaScript**. All non-critical JavaScript code has been relocated to the bottom of storefront pages, which speeds up page rendering and allows users to see the complete page sooner while nonessential elements remain inactive. To enable this performance enhancement, you must navigate to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Developer** > **JavaScript Settings** and enable the **Move JS code to the bottom of the page** option.   <!--- MC-15439-->

### Infrastructure improvements

This release contains 130 enhancements to core quality, which improve the quality of the Framework and these modules: `Catalog`, `Sales`, `Checkout/One Page Checkout`,  `UrlRewrite`, `Customer/Customers`, and `UI`. Here are some additional core enhancements:

*  **Braintree payment method is now supported for checkout with multiple addresses**. Previously, you could not use Braintree and Braintree PayPal when checking out an order that was being shipped to multiple addresses.<!---MAGETWO-98424-->

*  **The CGI URL gateway in UPS module has been updated from HTTP to HTTPS**. The CGI URL gateway endpoint in the UPS module has been updated  from HTTP to HTTPS in response to the disablement of the HTTP gateway by UPS in mid-2019. See [Magento User Guide](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/shipping/ups.html) for information about using the UPS shipment method. Shipping method configuration settings are described in  [Shipping methods](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/configuration/sales/shipping-methods.html#UPS). <!--- MAGETWO-98947-->

*  **Google chart API updated to the Image-Charts**. Magento now uses the Image-Charts free service to render static charts in Admin dashboards. Earlier deployments used Google Image Charts, which was deprecated in 2012 and turned off on [March 18, 2019](https://developers.google.com/chart/image/docs/making_charts). <!--- MAGETWO-98833-->

### Merchant tool enhancements

Magento now performs the following tasks as **asynchronous background processes** and sends system messages to alert Admin users when tasks complete. Moving these common administrative tasks to the background frees administrators to work on other tasks while the initial tasks are processing.

*  Discount coupon generation. See [Coupon Code](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/marketing/price-rules-cart-coupon.html).

<!--- MC-13615-->

*  Mass editing of products.

<!--- MC-13613-->

*  Data export. Previously, connection timeouts occurred during export of large data sets (for example, the export of 200,000 products). See [Export](https://docs.magento.com/m2/b2b/user_guide/system/data-export.html) for more information.

 <!--- MC-5953-->

### Vendor-developed extension enhancements

This release of Magento includes extensions developed by third-party vendors.

#### Amazon Pay

Amazon Pay is now compliant with the PSD2 directive for UK and Germany. See [Payment services (PSD 2) - Directive (EU)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366_en) for an introduction to PSD2.

## Fixed issues

We've fixed hundreds of issues in the Magento 2.3.2 core code.

### Installation, upgrade, deployment

<!--- ENGCOM-4602-->

*  `configFactory` `scope` and `scope_code` values are now passed to `configFactory`   as data arrays. *Fix submitted by [ochnygosch](https://github.com/ochnygosch) in pull request [22012](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22012)*. [GitHub-21993](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21993)

<!--- ENGCOM-4582-->

*  Magento now renders the value of configuration variables (such as `{{unsecure_base_url}}`) as they are entered in  configuration files rather than saving the resolved value. Previously, Magento resolved the variable to its actual value, which lead to the overwriting the value in the database when the configuration was saved instead of storing the value in the variable. *Fix submitted by [Pieter Hoste ](https://github.com/hostep) in pull request [18067](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18067)*. [GitHub-15972](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15972)

<!--- ENGCOM-4751-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when you use  `app:config:import` to import configuration settings. Previously, the import failed, and Magento threw the following error even when the imported file contained only minor changes to password or URL values: `Please specify the admin custom URL`. *Fix submitted by [David Alger](https://github.com/davidalger) in pull request [22281](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22281)*. [GitHub-15090](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15090)

<!--- MAGETWO-95675-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when executing `bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy` in parallel mode if theme or locale deployment takes more than 400 seconds. Previously, Magento threw the following error under these conditions: `2436; Status: 0`.

<!--- ENGCOM-4794-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error during catalog set up when you run `bin/magento setup:upgrade`. Previously, set up failed, and Magento threw the following error even though no problems existed with your catalog, `Magento\Catalog\Setup\Media does not exist`. *Fix submitted by [Pieter Hoste](https://github.com/hostep) in pull request [22446](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22446)*. [GitHub-22124](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22124)

<!--- ENGCOM-4815-->

[GitHub-22474](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22474)

<!--- ENGCOM-4753-->

*  Updated the email template stylesheet for the Magento default and Luma themes to correctly specify the `.no-link` selector. This update fixes the following less compilation error that displayed when compiling the `email-inline.less` file using less.js compiler v2.73: `extend ' .no-link a' has no matches`. *Fix submitted by [Pieter Hoste](https://github.com/hostep) in pull request [22332](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22332)*. [GitHub-22330](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22330)

### Backend

<!--- MAGETWO-98183-->

*  The **State/Province** field is no longer marked as mandatory in the Admin customer address form. Previously, this field was always marked by an asterisk, even when the field was not required.

<!--- ENGCOM-4270-->

*  The icon that identifies a dropdown menu throughout the product interface now reflects the changing state of the dropdown menu's status (expanded or collapsed). *Fix submitted by [Eduard Chitoraga](https://github.com/eduard13) in pull request [21197](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21197)*. [GitHub-21196](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21196)

<!--- ENGCOM-3924-->

[GitHub-20337](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20337)

<!--- ENGCOM-4377-->

*  Magento now displays the correct date in the Admin for scheduled design changes.

[GitHub-19632](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19632)

<!--- ENGCOM-4336-->

[GitHub-21384](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21384)

<!--- ENGCOM-4655-->

*  Magento retains the filter settings you enter on the **Admin** > **System** > **Permissions** > **All Users** list when you click on an item in the filtered list, then return to the list. Previously, if you navigated away from the list and then returned, all filter parameters were lost. *Fix submitted by [Jay Ghosh](https://github.com/jayankaghosh) in pull request [22128](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22128)*. [GitHub-21824](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21824)

<!--- ENGCOM-4711-->

*  The web setup wizard now uses the correct base path to check if the setup folder exists. Previously, the wizard checked `base/data/web/magento2/pubsetup` instead of `/data/web/magento2/pub/setup`. *Fix submitted by [Jeroen ](https://github.com/JeroenVanLeusden) in pull request [20182](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20182)*. [GitHub-7623](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/7623), [GitHub-11892](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11892)

<!--- ENGCOM-4397-->

*  Magento now redirects to you the Admin home page or a 404 page as expected when you try to access a nonexisting Admin page and **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **Admin** > **Security** > **Add Secret Key to URLs** is enabled. Previously,  redirects did not work properly, and Magento displayed the following message, `The page isn’t redirecting properly`. *Fix submitted by [Jitheesh V O](https://github.com/Jitheesh) in pull request [21455](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21455)*. [GitHub-21454](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21454)

### Back up

<!--- ENGCOM-4782-->

*  Magento now creates the `var/.maintenance.flag`  file as expected when you start a database backup  (**System** > **Tools** > **Backups** > **Database Backup**). Previously, Magento did not create this  file, but instead displayed the following error: `Error: You need more permissions to activate maintenance mode right now. To create the backup, please deselect "Put store into maintenance mode" or update your permissions`. *Fix submitted by [Hiren Pandya](https://github.com/hiren0241) in pull request [19993](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19993)*. [GitHub-19825](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19825)

### Bundle

<!--- ENGCOM-4507-->

*  Magento now calculates and displays the correct tier price for bundle products. *Fix submitted by [Adarsh Khatri](https://github.com/adarshkhatri) in pull request [21469](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21469)*. [GitHub-21467](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21467)

<!--- MAGETWO-98603-->

*  Tier pricing for bundle products now works as expected: Magento displays the correct  price in the cart, and reminds customers that they can buy a specific quantity of the  product for a discount. Previously, Magento did not calculate the price correctly and did not display any informative messages about tier pricing on the category and product pages.

### Cache

<!--- ENGCOM-4745-->

*  CMS block cache keys now contain the appropriate store ID in deployments with multiple store views. Previously, Magento always loaded the cached version of the block for the first store view. *Fix submitted by [Marius Strajeru](https://github.com/tzyganu) in pull request [22302](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22302)*. [GitHub-22299](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22299)

### Cart and checkout

<!--- MAGETWO-97968-->

*  Magento now correctly updates the mini cart if a selected product is disabled during the shopping session.

<!--- MAGETWO-98620-->

*  Magento now persists the shipping quote in the shopping cart for guest customers when **Persistent Shopping Cart** is enabled.

<!--- ENGCOM-3477-->

*  Magento now persists customer-related values after a guest customer converts her account to a customer account after checkout. Previously, Magento saved these customer-related values as null during account creation after checkout. *Fix submitted by [Nazar Klovanych](https://github.com/Nazar65) in pull request [19191](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19191)*. [GitHub-19166](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19166)

<!--- ENGCOM-4237-->

*  Guests can now complete checkout when a custom shipping carrier with underscores in the carrier code is used. Previously, Magento threw the following exception under these conditions: `Please specify a shipping method`. *Fix submitted by [vovsky](https://github.com/vovsky) in pull request [19505](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19505)*. [GitHub-5021](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/5021)

<!--- ENGCOM-3900-->

*  Fixed alignment of the **Update** button on the payment page of the checkout workflow. *Fix submitted by [Govind Sharma](https://github.com/GovindaSharma) in pull request [20307](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20307)*. [GitHub-20305](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20305)

<!--- ENGCOM-3849-->

*  Magento no longer displays the infinite loading indicator when you proceed to check out. Previously, Magento displayed the loading indicator, and threw the following JavaScript error: `Cannot read property 'quoteData' of undefined`. *Fix submitted by [Ihor Sviziev](https://github.com/ihor-sviziev) in pull request [18503](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18503)*. [GitHub-14412](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14412)

<!--- ENGCOM-4355-->

*  Magento now displays an error message as expected when a customer clicks on **Add to cart**  without selecting at least one product from the recently ordered  product list. *Fix submitted by [Prince Patel](https://github.com/mageprince) in pull request [21401](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21401)*. [GitHub-21398](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21398)

<!--- ENGCOM-4376-->

*  The **Cancel** button on the checkout page now works as expected. *Fix submitted by [Jitheesh V O](https://github.com/Jitheesh) in pull request [21356](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21356)*. [GitHub-21327](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21327)

<!--- ENGCOM-4362-->

*  Magento no longer runs `UpdateItemQty` validation before a Clear Shopping Cart action is triggered. Previously, due to the timing of this validation, you could not empty the shopping cart if any product in the cart was out-of-stock. *Fix submitted by [Wojtek Naruniec](https://github.com/wojtekn) in pull request [21295](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21295)*. [GitHub-21294](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21294)

<!--- MAGETWO-70996-->

*  Magento now uses the value of the default billing address attribute as expected during checkout. [GitHub-8777](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8777)

<!--- ENGCOM-4783-->

*  Magento now validates the shipping information section of checkout as expected. Previously, a customer could proceed to the Payment Details section of checkout without having added valid shipping details. *Fix submitted by [Nirav Patel](https://github.com/niravkrish) in pull request [22405](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22405)*. [GitHub-21596](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21596)

<!--- ENGCOM-4414-->

*  The `label` elements  on the checkout address input fields are now readable by screen readers. Previously, the  address input fields did not have a `label` element with a valid value, which prevented screen readers from reading the values. *Fix submitted by [Scott Buchanan ](https://github.com/scottsb) in pull request [21484](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21484)*. [GitHub-10893](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10893)

<!--- ENGCOM-4691-->

*  New downloadable products now show up in a customer's My Downloadable products list after a customer who completed a purchase as a guest then creates an account. *Fix submitted by [Jitheesh V O](https://github.com/Jitheesh) in pull request [21711](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21711)*. [GitHub-21702](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21702)

<!--- MC-5681-->

*  The checkout page now provides the ability to search addresses instead of listing addresses only on the Select shipping and Billing address steps. This new search feature can substantially increase checkout performance for customers with thousands of addresses. It is disabled by default and  must be enabled from Admin.  See [Checkout](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/configuration/sales/checkout.html#Checkout).

### Cart Price rules

<!--- MAGETWO-98680-->

*  Magento now displays the Cart Price Rule code on an order details Admin page if free shipping applies. Previously, Magento did not display information about the Sales rule or why shipping was free.

### Catalog

<!--- MAGETWO-57934-->

*  You can now use the term **configurable** as a group name in attribute sets. Previously, Magento threw an error when you used this term as a group name and subsequently tried to add or edit a product. [GitHub-6123](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/6123)

<!--- MAGETWO-96429-->

*  Product search results now display the correct special price as set by a scheduled update. Previously, search results displayed the original special price, not the price set by the scheduled update.

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-note}
This fix can degrade performance in deployments that implement flat catalogs. To avoid this potential performance degradation, consider disabling flat catalogs.

<!--- MAGETWO-96416-->

*  Clicking on a store's root category now causes only that root category to expand. Previously, Magento expanded all other Root Categories into the top-level categories.

<!--- MAGETWO-96127-->

*  Magento now maintains correct pagination when a Catalog list has multiple pages of products.  Previously, users were redirected to the first page (instead of the correct page) after navigating to a product from the list and saving it.

<!--- MAGETWO-64260-->

*  We have improved the performance of the grouped product detail pages and category pages that contain a large number of grouped products.

<!--- MAGETWO-98335-->

*  You can now use storeview-level attributes to filter products on the products list.

<!--- MAGETWO-97966-->

*  Magento does not display the Country of Manufacture field under the More Information tab of the product page when this value is empty.

<!--- ENGCOM-3767-->

*  A product's  `product:price:amount` metatag now contains the price converted to the appropriate base currency in multistore deployments with stores using different base currencies. Previously, the price in this metatag was always calculated in the base currency. *Fix submitted by [Milind Singh](https://github.com/milindsingh) in pull request [20011](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20011)*. [GitHub-20010](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20010)

<!--- ENGCOM-4217-->

*  Magento now correctly calculates multi-currency custom option prices when the option price type is `percentage`. Previously, when the multi-currency custom option was set to a percentage price type, Magento calculated the price incorrectly. *Fix submitted by [Emipro Technologies Pvt Ltd](https://github.com/emiprotech) in pull request [19608](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19608)*. [GitHub-19561](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19561)

<!--- ENGCOM-4065-->

*  The  `product_types_base.xsd`, `product_options.xsd`, `import.xsd`, `export.xsd` files  now allow modules with names that contain  numbers. *Fix submitted by [Lisovyi Yevhenii](https://github.com/lisovyievhenii) in pull request [20617](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20617)*. [GitHub-14882](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14882)

   *  `--lock-zookeeper-path=LOCK-ZOOKEEPER-PATH`— The path where Zookeeper will save locks. The default path is /magento/locks

   *  `--lock-file-path=LOCK-FILE-PATH`—The path where file locks will be saved.

*  Added an `is_array` parameter value check to the `getOptionText($value)` function in `app/code/Magento/Eav/Model/Entity/Attribute/Source/AbstractSource.php` to fix an error that caused Magento to throw a UI error when you make the `_quantity_and_stock_status (Qty)_` product attribute visible in the storefront properties. Previously, the `getOptionText($value)` function expected integer or string input and failed because the `quantity_and_stock_status (Qty)` configuration parameters were passed as an array.` *Fix submitted by [Aditi Singh](https://github.com/aditisinghcedcoss) in pull request [20001](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20001)*.

<!--- ENGCOM-4333-->

*  Running the `php bin/magento setup:upgrade` command on modules that have a `db_schema.xml` without an `indexType` now creates the index, and subsequent runs result in no modifications as expected.

#### Cache framework

<!--- ENGCOM-3470-->

*  The purge cache feature in `\Magento\CacheInvalidate\Model\PurgeCache::sendPurgeRequest` has been updated to flush the cache on all hosts even when a Varnish servers is offline.

<!--- ENGCOM-4055-->

*  The sitemap generation `cron` job no longer flushes the entire cache.

### Google Chart API

<!--- MAGETWO-98584 -->

*  The Google chart API has been updated to the Image-Charts. Magento now uses the Image-Charts free service to render static charts in Admin dashboards.

[GitHub-21599](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21599)

### Import/export

<!--- MAGETWO-95313-->

<!--- MAGETWO-70232-->

*  Magento now displays informative messages when you create a new product and try to set its SKU to one that is assigned to an existing product.

<!--- ENGCOM-4281-->

*  The import process  `replace` method now works as expected. *Fix submitted by [Denys Saltanakhmedov](https://github.com/DenisSaltanahmedov) in pull request [21189](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21189)*. [GitHub-18761](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18761)

[GitHub-19761](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19761)

### Infrastructure

*  The default behavior of view models has changed in this release. Instances of view models are now shared by default. As a result, you must add the `attribute shared="false"` on the argument node of the `layout.xml` file if you want a new instance of a view model.

<!--- ENGCOM-4474-->

*  The `FrontController` now explicitly requires actions to specify if they respond to `HEAD` requests. `HEAD` action mapping has also been changed to the  `GET` action interface, which results in `HEAD` requests returning `200` instead of `404`. *Fix submitted by [Matti Vapa](https://github.com/mattijv) in pull request [21378](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21378)*.

<!--- ENGCOM-4482-->

*  Logic has been removed from the constructor of `Magento\Sales\Model\Order\Address\Validator`.

<!--- ENGCOM-4527-->

*  The `getSize()` method in `\Magento\Framework\Data\Collection` now returns results that reflect added filters as expected when the `clear()` method is called after `getSize()`. Previously, this method returned results that always remained the same after the first call and the `clear()` method was ignored.*Fix submitted by [Sergey Nezbritskiy](https://github.com/sergeynezbritskiy) in pull request [21670](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21670)*.

<!--- ENGCOM-4545-->

*  Magento no longer caches absolute file paths in  the validator factory  (`Magento\Framework\Validator\Factory::_initializeConfigList`). Previously, caching absolute file paths resulted in problems during transactions when a customer, a `customer_address`, or quote for a registered customer was saved. *Fix submitted by [David Führ](https://github.com/david-fuehr) in pull request [21856](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21856)*.

<!--- ENGCOM-4585-->

*  Magento no longer throws an exception under these conditions:

   *  a product configuration specifies a `Minimum Qty Allowed in Shopping Cart` as a decimal value less than one

   *  this configuration is later updated by setting  `Qty Uses Decimals`  to **no**, and later updating the **Qty Uses Decimals** attribute in the product congiration to **no**. *Fix submitted by [Valerij Ivashchenko](https://github.com/likemusic) in pull request [21928](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21928)*.

<!--- ENGCOM-4458-->

*  Magento now retrieves the configuration value (store ID)  that is  based on the current store scope in multistore deployments. Previously, Magento occasionally returned an incorrect configuration scope ID when attempting to resolve a scope ID set to null. *Fix submitted by [Pratik Oza](https://github.com/mage2pratik) in pull request [21633](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21633)*. [GitHub-16939](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/16939)

### Logging

<!--- ENGCOM-4505-->

*  Magento now creates a log entry if an observer does not implement ObserverInterface in modes other than developer mode.  Previously, Magento created a log entry when in developer mode only. *Fix submitted by [Nazar Klovanych ](https://github.com/Nazar65) in pull request [21767](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21767)*.

*  Improved performance of New Relic queries. The New Relic Reporting module now cleans the Magento 2.x report data to prevent the reporting data store from growing too large and slowing query performance.

<!--- ENGCOM-4634-->

*  Magento 2.x CLI command names are now reported in the transaction names in the New Relic APM Monitoring Data. The transaction name is based on the Magento CLI command name, for example `cli app:config:import`, `cli indexer:reindex`, and `cli cache:flush`. In previous releases, the New Relic transaction names for CLI commands initiated by Magento 2.x CLI command names was missing and reported as unknown. *Fix submitted by [Lukasz Bajsarowicz](https://github.com/lbajsarowicz) in pull request [22059](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22059)*. [GitHub-22047](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22047)

### Newsletter

<!--- MAGETWO-98617-->

*  You can now change pages at an expected speed from the Admin newsletter subscribers page (**Marketing** > **Communications** > **Newsletter Subscribers**). Previously, it took excessively long to move off this page.

<!--- ENGCOM-3992-->

*  The newsletter subscription input box now displays all text in mobile view. *Fix submitted by [Arvinda kumar](https://github.com/cedarvinda) in pull request [20165](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20165)*. [GitHub-20163](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20163)

### Orders

<!--- ENGCOM-4673-->

*  The quick order form now handles the SKUs that you enter for configurable products as expected. Previously, Magento threw an error when you tried to enter the SKU for a configurable product, and displayed a link to the simple product which typically returned a 404 page.

<!--- ENGCOM-4739-->

*  Programatically created invoices now include all items as expected when both simple products and bundled products are mixed in an order. Previously, when  Magento\Sales\Model\Service\InvoiceService::prepareInvoice was called without a specified quantity, the function did not discards items as expected after bundled items were processed, which resulted in a partial invoice. *Fix submitted by [Ryan Palmer]](https://github.com/ryanpalmerweb) in pull request [22263](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22263)*. [GitHub-22246](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22246)

<!--- ENGCOM-4524-->

*  When you create new extension attributes for orders, these attributes are now correctly joined when querying orders. *Fix submitted by [Oleksandr Kravchuk]](https://github.com/swnsma) in pull request [21797](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21797)*. [GitHub-8035](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8035)

### Page cache

<!--- MAGETWO-91607-->

*  Page cache is no longer active when maintenance mode is enabled.  Previously, Magento cached  pages from all IP addresses during maintennce mode.

### Payment methods

<!--- MAGETWO-99307-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error indicating that a transaction was declined when Authorize.net successfully processes the order. Previously, orders were successfully created but Authorize.net indicated that the transaction had been declined.  [GitHub-22373](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22373)

<!--- MAGETWO-99094-->

*  Magento creates an order using PayPal PayflowPro as expected when a customer enters all the credit card information that PayPal needs to create the transaction. Previously, Magento did not create the order even though all necessary credit card information has been entered.

<!--- ENGCOM-4192-->

*  Alt attribute text that describes  credit card type or stored payment methods during checkout has been added to supprt accessibility. *Fix submitted by [Patrick McLain](https://github.com/pmclain) in pull request [21090](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21090)*. [GitHub-21089](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21089)

### Performance

<!--- MC-16005-->

*  Client-side performance has been optimized by moving non-critical JavaScript code to the bottom of the page along with the corresponding deferred parsing and evaluation of this code. This means that users can see  rendered pages faster. To enable this performance enhancement, you must navigate to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Developer** > **JavaScript Settings** and enable the **Move JS code to the bottom of the page** option.

<!--- MAGETWO-96138-->

*  The transfer cart line items and transfer shipping options in the the Shipping step of checkout now work for PayPal. [GitHub-19064](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19064)

<!--- MAGETWO-98424-->

*  The multishipping checkout flow now supports the Braintree payment method.

<!--- ENGCOM-4650-->

*  Magento no longer disables the **Place order** button in the checkout workflow after the customer has supplied the requested email address for orders created with Braintree. *Fix submitted by [Roman Kis](https://github.com/kisroman) in pull request [21936](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21936)*[GitHub-21907](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21907)

<!--- MC-6273-->

*  We've optimized the logic of concurrent access to the block cache, which  has improved the response of storefront pages under high load by approximately 20%.

### Quote

<!--- ENGCOM-4520-->

*  `QuoteManagement::submitQuote` now logs all root exceptions. Previously, Magento logged only the second exception in `exception.log`.  *Fix submitted by [David Führ ](https://github.com/david-fuehr) in pull request [21697](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21697)*. [GitHub-14926](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14926), [GitHub-18752](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18752)

<!--- ENGCOM-4712-->

*  The `x_forwarded_for` field of the Quote Management service now contains the value from `$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']`. Previously, this field was always empty. This change will permit administrators to see their customer's actual IP addresses (as opposed to 127.0.0.1), which can help identify potentially fraudulent orders. *Fix submitted by [Christian Münch](https://github.com/cmuench) in pull request [21787](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21787)*. [GitHub-](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/)

<!--- ENGCOM-4747-->

*  The downloads report table (**Admin** > **Reports** > **Downloads**) now displays an accurate count of all downloadable products and the number of times they have been downloaded. *Fix submitted by [Shikha Mishra](https://github.com/shikhamis11) in pull request [22291](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22291)*. [GitHub-22223](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22223)

### Reviews

<!--- ENGCOM-4241-->

*  You can now change customer groups when creating a new customer during order creation on the Admin. *Fix submitted by [gauravagarwal1001](https://github.com/gauravagarwal1001) in pull request [21145](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21145)*.

<!--- MAGETWO-97423-->

*  When you place an Admin order for a product with a custom price, the `sales_order_item` table now behaves the same as it would for an order of a product with a regular price. Specifically, the price column  contains the custom price excluding tax. Previously, the `sales_order_item` table's price column displayed the custom price including tax.

<!--- ENGCOM-4238-->

*  Form validation now works as expected for fields in the Admin order address edit forms. Previously, when you entered invalid data, Magento did not display an error message and displayed the data. *Fix submitted by [Ievgenii Gryshkun](https://github.com/XxXgeoXxX) in pull request [20840](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20840)*. [GitHub-19360](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19360)

<!--- ENGCOM-3910-->

*  If you retrieve an order, and then use the `getShippingMethod` as object function to retrieve the shipping method, Magento now returns `null` if no shipping method has been defined. Previously, this function returned an undefined index error if a shipping method was not available. *Fix submitted by [Mahesh Singh](https://github.com/maheshWebkul721) in pull request [20381](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20381)*.

[GitHub-20888](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20888)

<!--- ENGCOM-4406-->

*  Added a condition `type _Subtotal (Excl. Tax)` to the Cart Price Rule configuration so that you can configure a cart price discount rule discount based on minimum purchase amount that excludes tax. Previously, the subtotal was calculated only with tax included. *Fix submitted by [AleksLi](https://github.com/AleksLi) in pull request [21288](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21288)*. [GitHub-12396](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12396)

*  Catalog search **Minimal Query Length** values are now enforced as expected.

<!--- MAGETWO-97830-->

<!--- ENGCOM-4109-->

*  The performance of layered navigation queries has been improved. *Fix submitted by [Mads Nielsen](https://github.com/k4emic) in pull request [20971](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20971)*. [GitHub-20969](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20969)

<!--- ENGCOM-4481-->

*  The search REST API now returns the correct `total_count` of result items. Previously, the value of `total_count`  equaled `searchCriteria[pageSize]`,  not the total count of the search result items. *Fix submitted by [Ronak Patel](https://github.com/ronak2ram) in pull request [21713](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21713)*.

<!--- ENGCOM-4620-->

*  Magento now checks concrete class while applying plugins. Previously, when  the pluginized class was virtual-typed by a class with name ending with an autogenerated suffix and without the implementation of the base concrete class, the `di:compile` process failed.  *Fix submitted by [Riccardo Tempesta](https://github.com/phoenix128) in pull request [22046](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22046)*.

*  Magento no longer uploads images to the Category page unless the **Use Default Value** attribute is enabled. *Fix submitted by [Serhiy Zhovnir](https://github.com/serhiyzhovnir) in pull request [20461](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20461)*. [GitHub-20376](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20376)

### URL rewrites

<!--- ENGCOM-4357-->

*  Added a feature to manage URL rewrites when the product visibility attribute changes. If the product is made invisible, Magento deletes the URL rewrite. If you change the visibility attribute to true, Magento creates a URL rewrite rule. Previously, changing the visibility attribute sometimes created duplicate product URLs. *Fix submitted by [Vitaliy ](https://github.com/VitaliyBoyko) in pull request [20774](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20774)*. [GitHub-20434](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20434)

*  URLS in Arabic now resolve as expected. Previously, when you created a URL rewrite in Arabic, the browser returned a 404.

<!--- ENGCOM-4586-->

*  Magento now retains filter terms after you've applied a filter to the Admin `url_rewrites` table, then click the back button. *Fix submitted by [Vaibhav Bhalerao](https://github.com/vbmagento) in pull request [21834](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21834)*. [GitHub-21805](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21805)

### Web API framework

<!--- ENGCOM-4771-->

*  You can now use REST in scope `all` to save an existing category that does not have a `name` attribute. Previously, Magento threw this exception, `Could not save category with message. The "Name" attribute value is empty. Set the attribute and try again`. *Fix submitted by [Nirav Patel](https://github.com/niravkrish) in pull request [22362](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22362)*. [GitHub-22309](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22309)

<!--- ENGCOM-4674-->

*  The REST-API locale now matches the appropriate store view in multistore deployments. Previously, Magento used the default scope for each store view. *Fix submitted by [Julian Wundrak](https://github.com/jwundrak) in pull request [19913](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19913)*. [GitHub-19908](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19908)

<!--- ENGCOM-4173-->

*  You can now use `/rest/all/V1/products/`  to update a product's `category_ids` through `custom_attribute` when the product has no custom attributes. Previously, the `update` command reported success, but categories were not updated. *Fix submitted by [Yaroslav Gyryn](https://github.com/ygyryn) in pull request [20842](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20842)*. [GitHub-20481](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20481)

<!--- ENGCOM-4786-->

*  `PUT /V1/products/:sku/media/:entryId` now updates product images as expected. Previously, this call updated label, types and disabled, but the actual `file-content` was not replaced with the values that were provided in `base64_encoded_data`.

*Fix submitted by [Nazar Klovanych](https://github.com/Nazar65) in pull request [22424](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22424)*. [GitHub-22402](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22402)

### Wishlist

<!--- ENGCOM-4460-->

*  Customer wishlists now include review summaries for included products. *Fix submitted by [Denis Kopylov](https://github.com/Den4ik) in pull request [21420](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21420)*. [GitHub-21419](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21419)

<!--- MAGETWO-62728-->

*  The wishlist quantity field now has limits on both the type and number of characters that can be entered. Previously, you could enter both extremely large number and letters into this field, which resulted in undesirable, inaccurate changes in quantity.

<!--- ENGCOM-3715-->

*  Magento now alerts you to the expected minimum quantity of product when you try to add a lesser product quantity to your shopping cart from the wishlist. *Fix submitted by [Khodu](https://github.com/khodu) in pull request [19653](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19653)*. [GitHub-9155](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9155)

### WYSIWYG

<!--- ENGCOM-4664-->

*  You can now insert widgets that contain a WYSIWYG field into a form. Previously, widgets with a `WYSIWYG` parameter failed when inserting them into a WYSIWYG in a form. *Fix submitted by [James Dinsdale](https://github.com/molovo) in pull request [20174](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20174)*. [GitHub-19742](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19742)

## Known issues

*  **Issue**: The Async/Bulk Web APIs support only the default store view. A hot fix for this issue will be available in the near future. This issue has been resolved with the Scope parameter for Async/Bulk API patch, which is now available. See [Patch for Magento Framework Message Queue and Store Scopes](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Patch-for-Magento-Framework-Message-Queue-and-Store-Scopes/ba-p/135209) for a full discussion of this scope-related issue and patch contents.

*  **Issue**: The security enhancements that are part of Magento 2.3.2 require the installation of libsodium version 1.0.13 or higher. You will not be able to successfully install Magento Commerce 2.3.2 without first ensuring that your server runs  version 1.0.13 or higher. See [Libsodium releases](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases) for a description of the available releases and installation instructions.

*  **Issue**: After upgrade to Magento 2.3.2 Product Flat Data index takes significantly more time to reindex. See [GitHub-23462](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23462) for a full discussion of this issue.
