You create an [invoice](https://glossary.magento.com/invoice) after you receive payment for an order. In this example, the order was paid offline via a bank transfer. Therefore, you must tell Magento that payment for the order has been captured.

After you submit the invoice, Magento adjusts the Quantity per Source value for non-physical products.

## Capture payment {#capture-payment}

This example creates a full invoice.

**Endpoint:**

`POST <host>/rest/us/V1/order/3/invoice`

where `3` is the `orderid`

**Scope:**

`us` store view

**Headers:**

`Content-Type`: `application/json`

`Authorization`: `Bearer <admin token>`

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "capture": true,
  "notify": true
}
```

**Response:**

An invoice `id`, such as `3`.

## Verify this step {#verify-step}

1. Click **Sales** > **Invoices**. The invoice displays in the grid with a status of Paid. Then click **Sales** > **Orders**. The status is Processing.

1. Click **Catalog** > **Products**. For `vp1`, Magento adjusted the value of **Quantity per Source** and **Salable Quantity** to 9998 for all sources and stocks.
