In the previous step, the SSA recommended shipping 20 `sp1` items and 25 `sp2`items from Baltimore. It also recommended shipping 35 `sp2` items from Reno.

You can always override the SSA recommendations. It would be valid, for example, to ship all the `sp1` items and 50 `sp2` items from Reno, leaving 15 `sp2` items to be shipped from Baltimore.

Fulfilling the order requires two partial shipments (unless you want to create a scenario that also involves the Austin warehouse). In this example, we'll follow the SSA recommendations.

When you complete a partial or full shipment, Magento deducts the reserved products from corresponding sources.

## Ship from the Baltimore warehouse

You must use the `POST V1/shipment` endpoint to create a shipment.

**Endpoint**

`POST http://<host>/rest/us/V1/shipment`

**Scope**

`us` store view

**Headers**


`Content-Type`: `application/json`

`Authorization`: `Bearer <admin token>`

**Payload**

``` json
{
  "entity": {
  	"billing_address_id": 2,
    "customer_id": 2,
    "order_id": 1,
    "store_id": 2,
    "total_qty": 45,
  "items": [

## Verify this step {#verify-step}

1. Click **Sales** > **Shipments**. The two shipments for this order are displayed in the grid.
2. Click **Catalog** > **Products** to verify **Quantity per Source** values for each product has been deducted according to the selections made at shipment.
