One of the most significant parts of MSI is the Source Selection Algorithm (SSA). SSA analyzes and determines the best match for sources and shipping based on the priorities you specified in [Link stocks and sources
]({{ page.baseurl }}/rest/tutorials/msi-order-processing/order-intro.html). The algorithm also provides a list of source items with quantities to deduct per each source item.

For more information about shipping and SSAs, see the Wiki topic [Shipment and Order Management](https://github.com/magento-engcom/msi/wiki/Shipment-and-Order-Management){:target="_blank"}.

## Get the list of algorithms

Currently, MSI supports only the default SSA for priority. Third-party developers and future releases may add support for additional algorithms.

**Endpoint**

`GET http://<host>/rest/us/V1/inventory/source-selection-algorithm-list`

**Scope**

`us` store view

**Headers**

`Content-Type` `application/json`

`Authorization` `Bearer <admin token>`

**Payload**

Not appliable

**Response**

``` json
[
    {
        "code": "priority",
        "title": "Source Priority",
        "description": "Algorithm which provides Source Selections based on predefined priority of Source"
    }
]
```

## Run the SSA

The `POST V1/inventory/source-selection-algorithm-result` endpoint uses the algorithm defined by the `algorithmCode` attribute to calculate the recommended sources and quantities for each item defined in the `items` array.

This tutorial does not consider complications such selling out of products or back ordering. We can ask the SSA to determine the best way to immediately ship all the items ordered (20 items of product `sp1` and 60 items of product `sp2`).

**Endpoint**

`POST http://<host>/rest/us/V1/inventory/source-selection-algorithm-result`

**Scope**

`us` store view

**Headers**

`Content-Type`: `application/json`

`Authorization`: `Bearer <admin token>`

**Payload**

``` json
{
    "inventoryRequest": {
        "stockId": 2,
        "items": [{
            "sku": "sp1",
            "qty": 20
        },
        {
            "sku": "sp2",
            "qty": 60
        }]
    },
    "algorithmCode": "priority"
}
```

**Response**

The SSA recommends shipping from the following sources:

Product | Source | Quantity
--- | --- | ---
`sp1` | Baltimore | 20
`sp2` | Baltimore | 25
`sp2` | Reno | 35

``` json
{
    "source_selection_items": [
        {
            "source_code": "baltimore_wh",
            "sku": "sp1",
            "qty_to_deduct": 20,
            "qty_available": 50
        },
        {
            "source_code": "austin_wh",
            "sku": "sp1",
            "qty_to_deduct": 0,
            "qty_available": 10
        },
        {
            "source_code": "reno_wh",
            "sku": "sp1",
            "qty_to_deduct": 0,
            "qty_available": 100
        },
        {
            "source_code": "baltimore_wh",
            "sku": "sp2",
            "qty_to_deduct": 25,
            "qty_available": 25
        },
        {
            "source_code": "reno_wh",
            "sku": "sp2",
            "qty_to_deduct": 35,
            "qty_available": 50
        }
    ],
    "shippable": true
}
```
