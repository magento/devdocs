*Release notes published March 2019.*

GraphQL is a flexible and performant API that allows you to build custom front-ends, including headless storefronts, [Progressive Web Apps](https://github.com/magento-research/pwa-studio) (PWA), and mobile apps for Magento.

The **[Magento GraphQL](https://github.com/magento/graphql-ce) project** is a Magento Community Engineering special project open to contributors.
To take part and contribute, see the [Magento GraphQL](https://github.com/magento/graphql-ce) repository and [wiki](https://github.com/magento/graphql-ce/wiki) to get started. Join us in our [Slack](https://magentocommeng.slack.com/messages/C8076E0KS) channel (or [self signup](https://tinyurl.com/engcom-slack)) to discuss the project.
