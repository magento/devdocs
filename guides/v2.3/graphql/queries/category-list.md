title: categoryList query
---

The `categoryList` query searches for categories that match the criteria specified in filters. It replaces the deprecated `category` query, which allowed you to search by category ID only.

The `categoryList` query supports the following types of filters. You can specify multiple filters in a query.

-  Category ID
-  Category name
-  URL Key

If you do not provide any filter input, the query returns the root category.

The query returns a `CategoryTree` object. The top level of the `CategoryTree` object provides details about the queried category. This object includes the `children` attribute, which contains an array of its immediate subcategories. To return multiple category levels in a single call, define the response so that it contains up to ten nested `children` options.

{:.bs-callout-info}
You cannot return the entire category tree if it contains more than ten sublevels unless the `queryDepth` parameter in the GraphQL `di.xml` file has been reconfigured.

Use the `breadcrumbs` attribute to return information about the parent categories of the queried category.

## Syntax

```graphql
categoryList (
   filters: CategoryFilterInput
): CategoryTree
```

## Example usage

### Return the category tree of a top-level category

The following query returns information about category IDs `11` and `20` and two levels of subcategories. In the sample data, category IDs `11` and `20` are assigned to the `Men` and `Women` categories, respectively.

**Request**

```graphql
{
  categoryList(filters: {ids: {in: ["11", "20"]}}) {
    children_count
    children {
      id
      level
      name
      path
      url_path
      url_key
      children {
        id
        level
        name
        path
        url_path
        url_key
      }
    }
  }
}
```
