title: createPaypalExpressToken mutation
---

The `createPaypalExpressToken` mutation begins the authorization process for the following payment methods:

*  PayPal Express Checkout
*  PayPal Payflow Pro with Express Checkout
*  PayPal Payflow Link with Express Checkout

The input includes the cart ID, the payment method code, and a set of URLs that PayPal uses to respond to the token request. If the request is successful, PayPal returns a token. The [`setPaymentMethodOnCart`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/set-payment-method.html) mutation uses this token later in the authorization process.

## Syntax

`mutation: {createPaypalExpressToken(input: PaypalExpressTokenInput!): {PaypalExpressToken}}`

## Example usage

**Request:**

```graphql
mutation {
    createPaypalExpressToken(

        paypal_urls{
            start
            edit
        }
    }
}
