The `setShippingAddressesOnCart` mutation sets one or more shipping addresses on a specific cart. The shipping address does not need to be specified in the following circumstances:

*  The cart contains only virtual items
*  When you defined the billing address, you set the `use_for_shipping` attribute to `true`. Magento assigns the same address as the shipping address.

## Syntax

`mutation: {setShippingAddressesOnCart(input: SetShippingAddressesOnCartInput) {SetShippingAddressesOnCartOutput}}`

## Example usage

**Request:**

```graphql
mutation {
  setShippingAddressesOnCart(
    input: {
