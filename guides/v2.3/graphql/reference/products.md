The `products` endpoint allows you to search for catalog items.

## Query structure

``` text
products(
    search: String
    filter: ProductFilterInput
    pageSize: Int
    currentPage: Int
    sort: ProductSortInput
): Products
```

Each query attribute is defined below:

Attribute |  Description
--- | ---
`search` | Performs a full-text search using the specified key words. This attribute is optional. See [Queries]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/queries.html) for more information.
`filter` | Identifies which attributes to search for and return. This attribute is required. See [ProductFilterInput](#ProductFilterInput) for more information.
`pageSize` | Specifies the maximum number of results to return at once. The default value is 20. See [Queries]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/queries.html) for more information.
`currentPage` | Specifies which page of results to return. The default value is 1. See [Queries]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/queries.html) for more information.
`sort` | Specifies which attribute to sort on, and whether to return the results in ascending or descending order. See [Queries]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/queries.html) for more information.
`Products` | An output object that contains the results of the query. See [Response](#Response) for details.


## ProductFilterInput object {#ProductFilterInput}

The `ProductFilterInput` object defines the filters to be used in the search. A filter contains at least one attribute, a comparison operator, and the value that is being searched for. The following example filter searches for products that has a `sku` that contains the string `24-MB` with a `price` that's less than `50`.

``` text
filter: {
  sku: {
    like: "24-MB%"
  }
  price: {
    lt: "50"
  }
}
```

See [Queries]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/queries.html) for more information about the operators.

Magento processes the attribute values specified in  a `ProductFilterInput` as  simple data types (strings, integers, booleans). However, returned attributes can be a different, complex, data type. For example, in a response, `price` is an object that contains a monetary value and a currency code.

The following attributes can be used to create filters. See the [Response](#Response) section for information about each attribute.

```text
category_id
country_of_manufacture
created_at
custom_layout
custom_layout_update
description
gift_message_available
has_options
image
image_label
manufacturer
max_price
meta_description
meta_keyword
meta_title
min_price
name
news_from_date
news_to_date
options_container
or
price
required_options
short_description
sku
small_image
small_image_label
special_from_date
special_price
special_to_date
thumbnail
thumbnail_label
tier_price
updated_at
weight
```

The following attributes are not used in responses:

* `or` - The keyword required to perform a logical OR comparison.
* `news_from_date` - This attribute is transformed to `news_from_date` in a response.
* `news_to_date` - This attribute is transformed to `news_to_date` in a response.

%}

## Response {#Response}

The system returns a `Products` object containing the following information:

```text
items: [ProductInterface]
page_info: SearchResultPageInfo
total_count: Int
filters: [LayerFilter]
sort_fields: SortFields
```

Each attribute is described below:

Attribute |  Description
--- | ---
`filters` | An array of layered navigation filters. These filters can be used to implement layered navigation on your app.
`items` | An array of products that match the specified search criteria.
`page_info` | An object that includes the `page_info` and `currentPage` values specified in the query
`sort_fields` | An object that includes the default sort field and all available sort fields
`total_count` | The number of products returned

When a product requires a filter attribute that is not a field on its output schema, inject the attribute name into the class in a module's `di.xml` file.

```xml
<type name="Magento\CatalogGraphQl\Model\Resolver\Products\FilterArgument\ProductEntityAttributesForAst" >
  <arguments>
    <argument name="additionalAttributes" xsi:type="array">
      <item name="field_to_sort" xsi:type="string">field</item>
      <item name="other_field_to_sort" xsi:type="string">other_field</item>
    </argument>
  </arguments>
</type>
```

This example adds `field_to_sort` and `other_field_to_sort` attributes to the `additionalAttributes` array defined in the `ProductEntityAttributesForAst` class. The array already contains the `min_price`, `max_price`, and `category_ids` attributes.

## ProductInterface {#ProductInterface}

Any type that implements `ProductInterface` contains all the base attributes necessary for the frontend of the product model.
The `items` that are returned in a `ProductInterface` array can also contain attributes from resources external to the CatalogGraphQl module:

* Custom and extension attributes defined in any attribute set
* The attribute is defined in the [PhysicalProductInterface](#PhysicalProductInterface) or [CustomizableOptionInterface]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/reference/customizable-option-interface.html)
* Product types that define their own implementation of `ProductInterface` including:
  * [BundleProduct]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/reference/bundle-product.html)
  * [ConfigurableProduct]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/reference/configurable-product.html)
  * [DownloadableProduct]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/reference/downloadable-product.html)
  * [GroupedProduct]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/reference/grouped-product.html)
