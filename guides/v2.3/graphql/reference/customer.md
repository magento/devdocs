The `Customer` endpoint returns information about a customer account.

Currently, GraphQL relies on [session authentication]({{ page.baseurl }}/get-started/authentication/gs-authentication-session.html). To successfully return information about a customer, you must be logged in as a customer in the same browser you are using to make GraphQL calls. The GraphQL call returns information about this customer.
