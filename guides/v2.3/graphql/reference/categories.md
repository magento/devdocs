title: category endpoint
---

The `category` endpoint allows you to search for a single category definition or the entire category tree. To return multiple category levels in a single call, define the response so that it contains up to ten nested `children` options. You cannot return the entire category tree if it contains more than 10 sublevels unless the `queryDepth` parameter in the GraphQL `di.xml` file has been reconfigured.
