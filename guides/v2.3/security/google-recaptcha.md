Google reCAPTCHA provides a greater level of security for both the storefront and Admin UI than is available with standard CAPTCHA, and gives you the ability to:

- Verify when customers create accounts, retrieve passwords, log in to their accounts, or contact your company.
- Enhance security when Admin users log in.

Google reCAPTCHA reduces potential user error when entering a Captcha code and encourages cart conversion without adding hurdles during checkout.

## Install Module

The Google reCAPTCHA extension installs when you install or upgrade to Magento Open Source or Commerce 2.3.X. This extensions installs like a Core Bundled Extension (CBE).

bin/magento msp:security:recaptcha:disable
```
