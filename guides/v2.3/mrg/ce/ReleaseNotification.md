 # Magento_ReleaseNotification Module

The **Release Notification Module** serves to provide a notification delivery platform for displaying new features of a Magento installation or upgrade as well as any other required release notifications.

## Purpose and Content

* Provides a method of notifying administrators of changes, features, and functionality being introduced in a Magento release.
* Displays a modal containing a high level overview of the features included in the installed or upgraded release of Magento upon the initial login of each administrator into the Admin Panel for a given Magento version.
* The modal is enabled with pagination functionality to allow for easy navigation between each modal page.
* Each modal page includes detailed information about a highlighted feature of the Magento release or other notification.
* Release Notification modal content is determined and provided by Magento Marketing.

## Content Retrieval

Release notification content is maintained by Magento for each Magento version, edition, and locale. To retrieve the content, a response is returned from a request with the following parameters:

*  **version** = The Magento version that the client has installed (ex. 2.3.0).
*  **edition** = The Magento edition that the client has installed (ex. Community).
*  **locale** = The chosen locale of the admin user (ex. en_US).

The module will make three attempts to retrieve content for the parameters in the order listed:

1. Version/Edition/Locale
2. Version/Edition/en_US (default locale)
3. Version (default file for a Magento version)

If there is no content to be retrieved after these requests, the release notification modal will not be displayed to the admin user.

## Content Guidelines

The modal system in the ReleaseNotification module can have up to four modal pages. The admin user can navigate between pages using the "< Prev" and "Next >" buttons at the bottom of the modal. The last modal page will have a "Done" button that will close the modal and record that the admin user has seen the notification. 

Each modal page can have the following optional content:

* Main Content
    * Title
    * URL to the image to be displayed alongside the title
    * Text body
    * Bullet point list
* Sub Headings (highlighted overviews of the content to be detailed on subsequent modal pages) - one to three Sub Headings may be displayed
    * Sub heading title
    * URL to the image to be display before the sub heading title
    * Sub heading content
* Footer
    * Footer content text

The Sub Heading section is ideally used on the first modal page as a way to describe one to three highlighted features that will be presented in greater detail on the following modal pages. It is recommended to use the Main Content -> Text Body and Bullet Point lists as the paragraph and list content displayed on a highlighted feature's detail modal page.

A clickable link to internal or external content in any text field will be created by using the following format and opened in a new browser tab. Providing the URL for the link followed by the text to be displayed for that link in brackets will cause a clickable link to be created. The text between the brackets [text] will be the text that the clickable link shows.

### Link Format Example:

The text: `https://devdocs.magento.com/ [Magento DevDocs].` will appear as [Magento DevDocs](https://devdocs.magento.com/).
