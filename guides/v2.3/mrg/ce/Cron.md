{% include mrg/note.md %}

Cron is a module that enables scheduling of jobs. Other modules can add cron jobs by including crontab.xml in their etc directory. The command "bin/magento cron:run" should be run periodically to trigger the Cron module to run its scheduled jobs.
This module also allows administrators to tune cron options in Magento Admin.
