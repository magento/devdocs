We split the build phase into two separate processes so that you can use hooks to apply custom changes to the generated static content before packaging the application for deployment. The build:generate process generates code, applies patches, and generates static content. The build:transfer process deploys the application. See [Application hooks](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/cloud/project/project-conf-files_magento-app.html).|v2.1.4 and later, 2.2.x, 2.3.x|Jul 5
