*Release notes updated on March 22, 2018.*


We are pleased to present Magento Commerce 2.1.12. This release includes multiple enhancements to product security, a change to the Magento Admin to support recent USPS shipping changes, and a copyright update. 

Although this release includes these enhancements, no confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions, so we recommend that you upgrade your Magento software to the latest version as soon as possible.

See [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-223-2112-and-2018-security-update) for a comprehensive discussion of these issues.

For security reasons, this release limits the ability to use symlinks for <code>/media</code> and other folders. If you are using symlinks for deployment, or if your <code>/media</code> is using symlinks, you may experience problems uploading or removing images. Magento will announce a fix for this issue when available. See <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13929" target="_blank">GitHub-13929</a> for more information.

## Highlights

Magento 2.1.12 contains 38 security fixes and enhancements.  Look for the following highlights in this release:

* **Enhancements that help close authenticated Admin user remote code execution, unauthorized data leaks, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities**. See [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-223-2112-and-2018-security-update) for more information.

* **Change to Magento Admin to support upcoming USPS shipping changes**. On February 23, 2018, USPS  removed APIs that support the creation of shipping labels without postage. In response, weâ€™ve removed this functionality from the Magento Admin. Consequently, you cannot create and print shipping labels that do not have postage applied. If you require USPS postage printing capabilities, please visit [Magento Shipping](https://magento.com/products/shipping) to learn more, and explore various shipping extensions on Magento Marketplace. 

* **Updated copyright to 2018**.
