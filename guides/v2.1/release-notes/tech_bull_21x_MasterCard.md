*Technical Bulletin published on May 19, 2017 and edited on June 29, 2017.*

MasterCard recently added a new series of Bank Identification Numbers (BIN). As of June 30, 2017, MasterCard may fine merchants who do not support cards that use this new range of BIN numbers, and transactions on your store for customers using cards with these new BINs may fail. 

In response, we’ve issued a set of patches for the Magento 1.x versions that do not already support processing cards with this new range of BIN numbers. 

### Who is affected by this issue?

Magento Commerce (formerly Enterprise Edition) versions 1.14.3.0 and later and Magento Open Source (formerly Community Edition) versions 1.9.3.0 and later fully support the new MasterCard numbers. Similarly, Magento Open Source and Commerce 2.1.3 and later versions fully support this MasterCard BIN range update.

However, if you are using an older version of Magento, you must upgrade by June 30 to avoid fines and ensure the correct processing of payments made with these new BINs.
