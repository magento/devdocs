*Technical bulletin updated on May 17, 2017.*

These instructions apply to anyone upgrading to Magento Open Source (formerly Community Edition) or Magento Commerce (formerly Enterprise Edition) version 2.1.6 whose installation runs custom themes. This Technical Bulletin provides both a discussion of the issue and a link to our hot fix for 2.1.6. 

### Who needs this information?

You need to read this bulletin if you've upgraded to Magento 2.1.6 (Open Source or Commerce) and are experiencing any of the following issues: 

* all images on the product front end appear reduced in size, including the base image

* images do not have uniform sizes -- some are greatly reduced, while others appear as expected. (This particular anomaly occurs after you've run the `bin/magento catalog:images:resize` command.)

You cannot change the size of the base image within the gallery by editing `etc > view.xml`. Instead, using this method increases image size as well as gallery size, which renders the image out of alignment.

### Background

Magento 2.1.6 introduced a change in how the platform handles images associated with custom themes. The `frame` element adds white space around your image. In Magento 2.1.6, the default value of this optional setting is **true**. 

If your custom theme doesn't include the `frame` element, or a value has not been assigned to it, then Magento will rely upon the `product_image_white_borders` option in the Catalog module for the value of the `frame` option. The `product_image_white_borders` setting typically has a value of **1**,  but is overridden to **0** in the default Luma and Blank themes. 

### Action

We strongly recommend that you upgrade to  2.1.7 as soon as that release is available. Magento 2.1.7 will contain a fix for this issue as well as critically important security enhancements. We provide the hot fix described in this Technical Bulletin as a temporary fix only.
