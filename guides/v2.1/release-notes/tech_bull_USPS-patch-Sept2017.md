*Technical Bulletin published on September 10, 2017.*

*last revised: September 12, 2017* 



On September 1, USPS changed their First-Class Mail Parcel Service to First-Class Package Service – Retail. Because the First-Class Mail Parcel is no longer available after September 1,  Magento 1.x and 2.x merchants offering this service must change this service name in the `Usps.php` as soon as possible. 

If you do not take action, your store will not support checkout using the First-Class Package Service - Retail mailing option. 

### Who is affected by this issue?

Users of any version of Magento Open Source 1.x and Magento Commerce 1.x are affected by this change.

Users of any version of Magento Open Source and Magento Commerce earlier than 2.1.9 or 2.0.16 (expected to be released within the next week) are affected by this change, too. If you are running a store on any version of Magento 2.x prior to 2.1.9 or 2.0.16, you must follow the workaround detailed below.

If you are running a different shipping extension, contact your extension provider to determine whether you're affected, and if so, the remedial action to take.

### Recommended Magento 1.x actions

We’ve provided the following workaround to address this change to the USPS API. Additionally, we have released the `SUPEE-10336 for 1.x` patch for this issue. If you implement the following workaround, note that you must undo the workaround before installing the patch.

#### Access Magento 1.x patches

### Workaround for Magento 1.x

1) Navigate to `app/code/core/Mage/Usa/Model/Shipping/Carrier/Usps.php`.

3) Replace all the occurrences of `First-Class Mail Parcel` with `First-Class Package Service - Retail`.

4) Save your changes to `Usps.php`.
