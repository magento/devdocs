## Less compilation modes {#less_modes}

In the Magento application, the following modes of compiling `.less` files to CSS are implemented:

1.  **Server-side Less compilation** - This is the default compilation mode, and is the only option in [production application mode]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/bootstrap/magento-modes.html#production-mode). In this case the compilation is performed on the server, using the [Less PHP library](https://github.com/oyejorge/less.php).
2.  **Client-side Less compilation** - When your application is not in production mode, you can set Magento to compile `.less` files in a browser, using the [native `less.js` library](http://lesscss.org/usage/#using-less-in-the-browser)

To set the compilation mode:

1.  In the Magento Admin, navigate to **Stores** > **Settings** > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **Developer**.
2.  In the **Store View** dropdown field, select **Default Config**.
3.  Under **Frontend development workflow**, in the **Workflow type** field, select the compilation mode.
4.  Click **Save Config**.
5.  Make sure that the same compilation mode is set for each configuration scope. Switch the **Store View** dropdown field to the website scope, and then to the {% glossarytooltip ca5a9ff1-8182-4fc4-a34b-9b3f831dbf3f %}store view{% endglossarytooltip %}, to check the **Frontend development workflow** option. Change the option to match the default config if it is different.

### Server-side Less compilation {#server-side}

This section describes how the Less preprocessor works in server-side compilation mode.
For each CSS file included in the layouts, Less preprocessor:

1.  Checks if the requested `.css` file is found. If it is found, the pre-processor stops its execution. Otherwise, it proceeds to the next step.
2.  Changes the {% glossarytooltip 55774db9-bf9d-40f3-83db-b10cc5ae3b68 %}extension{% endglossarytooltip %} of the requested file to `.less` and tries to find the file using the [Magento fallback mechanism]({{ page.baseurl }}/frontend-dev-guide/themes/theme-inherit.html#theme-inherit-static). If the `.less` file is not found, the Less pre-processor stops its execution. Otherwise, it proceeds to the next step.
3.  Reads `.less` file contents and resolves [`@magento_import`](#fedg_css-magento-import) and default Less `@import` directives.
4.  Resolves all paths in `.less` files to relative paths in the system using the Magento fallback mechanism. All files resolved by the Less pre-processor are copied to `var/view_preprocessed/less`. Imported files are processed recursively.
5.  All source files are passed to the {% glossarytooltip bf703ab1-ca4b-48f9-b2b7-16a81fd46e02 %}PHP{% endglossarytooltip %} Less compiler. The resulting compiled `.css` files are published to `pub/static/frontend/<Vendor>/<theme>/<locale>`.

#### Styles debugging in server-side compilation mode {#css_debug_server}

In server-side Less compilation mode, to have your changes applied, clear `pub/static/frontend/<Vendor>/<theme>/<locale>` by deleting the directory in the file system (excluding .htaccess), and reload the store pages to trigger compilation and publication.

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
You might also need to clear the `var/cache` and `var/view_preprocessed` directories.

Alternatively, to streamline the process of applying and debugging styles customizations, in server-side compilation mode, you can use the [Grunt JavaScript task runner](http://gruntjs.com/).

See the [Compile Less with Grunt]({{ page.baseurl }}/frontend-dev-guide/css-topics/css_debug.html) topic for details on how to install, configure, and use Grunt.

### Client-side Less compilation {#client-side}

The client-side compilation flow is similar to the [server-side](#server-side) flow. The difference is in the set of files, published to `pub/static` on the last step. In the client-side mode, these files are published to the `pub/static/frontend/<Vendor>/<theme>/<locale>` directory:

*   Root source (.less) files with resolved `@magento_import` directive
*   [Symlinks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) to the root source file that do not contain `@magento_import`
*   Symlinks to all other `.less` files imported recursively by the `@magento_import` and `@import` directives

Symlink is not created, and a copy of the processed file is published to `pub/static` instead, if the source file differs from the processed one. One of the reasons for this difference might be the usage of the `@import` directive without the file extension in the source file. See [The @import directive usage](#fedg_css-import) for more details.

#### Styles debugging in client-side compilation mode {#css_debug_client}

Client-side Less compilation is implemented using the native `less.js` {% glossarytooltip 08968dbb-2eeb-45c7-ae95-ffca228a7575 %}library{% endglossarytooltip %}. The default configuration is set in `lib/web/less/config.less.js`. You can change it as needed.

Find detailed information about the configuration and other options of the `less.js` used in a browser at [http://lesscss.org/usage/#using-less-in-the-browser](http://lesscss.org/usage/#using-less-in-the-browser).

In client-side compilation mode, most of the stylesheet customizations display immediately after you reload a page in a browser.

There are certain types of changes, that require you to clear the `pub/static/frontend/<Vendor>/<theme>/<locale>` directory and trigger the compilation and [publication]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-static-view.html#config-cli-static-overview) processes anew.

This is required if:
*   You change the [root source files]({{ page.baseurl }}/frontend-dev-guide/css-topics/css-preprocess.html#css_preprocess_terms) that contain the `@magento_import` directive or the `@import` directive where the imported file is specified without extension.
*   You rename, remove, or add a `.less` file imported with a `@magento_import` or `@import` directive but you did not correct the directives accordingly.

To clear the `pub/static/frontend/<Vendor>/<theme>/<locale>` directory, delete the directory in the file system, and reload the store pages in a browser to trigger compilation and publication.

## The `@import` directive rules of usage {#fedg_css-import}

You can import local and remote `.less` and `.css` files in your `.less` Magento stylesheets by using the standard Less [`@import` directive](http://lesscss.org/features/#import-directives-feature).
According to the `@import` syntax, specifying the file extension for the imported file is not mandatory. For example, the following notation is allowed:

```css
@import 'source/lib/_lib';
@import (css) 'styles';
```

In process of resolving the file path, Magento adds the `.less` extension for the imported files in all `@import` entrees. So in the processed files, the statements from the previous example will look like:

```css
@import 'source/lib/_lib.less';
@import (css) 'styles.less';
```

As a result, the processed files are different from the source files. So in the [client-side compilation mode](#client-side), or when using [grunt commands]({{ page.baseurl }}/frontend-dev-guide/css-topics/css_debug.html), Magento cannot use symlinks to the source files. Instead it uses the copies of processed files, and they are published to the `pub/static` directory. In the case of importing CSS resources, this also results in not finding and not importing the required files.

### Import remote CSS files

If you need to import a remote CSS file in your `.less` source, use `url()` notation. For example, to import a Google font:

```css
@import url('//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Titillium+Web:400,300,200,600.css');
```
To [include the font]({{ page.baseurl }}/frontend-dev-guide/css-topics/using-fonts.html) in your theme's CSS files, use the `@font-face` CSS rule for the fastest loading time.

In this instance, Magento will skip the `@import` directive while resolving paths to the local resources.

## The `@magento_import` directive {#fedg_css-magento-import}

`@magento_import` is a Magento-specific Less directive that allows including multiple files by a name pattern. It is used to include files with the same name from the different locations, such as different modules. The standard `@import` directive includes a single file, which is found according to the [static files fallback]({{ page.baseurl }}/frontend-dev-guide/themes/theme-inherit.html#theme-inherit-static).

`@magento_import`can be used in the root source files of a {% glossarytooltip d2093e4a-2b71-48a3-99b7-b32af7158019 %}theme{% endglossarytooltip %} only.

### `@magento_import` rules of usage {#magento-import-usage}

To include a `.less` file using the `@magento_import` directive:

1. To avoid any conflicts with the original Less syntax, `@magento_import` must be commented out with two slashes. Otherwise, the Less preprocessor ignores it.

    **Example:**
    ```css
    //  Comment in a Less document
    
    //  Standard Less import directive
    //  ---------------------------------------------
    
    @import 'source/_reset';
    @import '_styles';
    
    //
    //  Custom Magento Less import directives
    //  ---------------------------------------------
    
    //@magento_import 'source/_module.less'; // Theme modules
    //@magento_import 'source/_widgets.less'; // Theme widgets
    //@magento_import 'source/_extend.less'; // Extend for minor customization
    ```

2. `@magento_import` must contain the file path. The path is specified relatively to the file, where the directive is called and put in either single ('') or double quotes ("").

    The best practice is to specify the file extension in the path, though technically you can omit this.

### `@magento_import` processing {#magento_import_example}

In the scope of static resources preprocessing, the built-in Less preprocessor:

1.  Searches for all `@magento_import` directives.
2.  Replaces the original `@magento_import` directives with the standard
    `@import` directives. The latter specify the paths to the particular
    files that correspond to the pattern specified in `@magento_import`.

`@magento_import` is used and processed in `<Magento_Blank_theme_dir>/web/css/styles-l.less`:

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Before
            </th>
            <th>
                After
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                In <code>/web/css/styles-l.less</code> there's a following
                directive:
                <pre>
 ..
//@magento_import 'source/_widgets.less'; // Theme widgets
..
</pre>
            </td>
            <td>
                <p>In the processed file, this results in the following:</p>
                <pre>
@import '../Magento_Catalog/css/source/_widgets.less';
@import '../Magento_Cms/css/source/_widgets.less';
@import '../Magento_Reports/css/source/_widgets.less';
@import '../Magento_Sales/css/source/_widgets.less';
 // Theme widgets
</pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
