## Abbreviations

Avoid the following:

* **Abbreviations for months and URLs.**  For details, see the [Dates]({{ page.baseurl }}/design-styleguide/number-formats/number-formats.html#dates-and-times) section in Number Formats.

* **Non-English words and abbreviations.** These are difficult to translate, and some users might be unfamiliar with them.

* **Latin abbreviations.** Abbreviations like i.e., e.g., and etc., are not universally known and are often misunderstood.

## Acronyms

When in doubt, spell it out. If there’s a chance a reader doesn't know an abbreviation or acronym, use the full term on first reference.

* **Use all caps case.**

* **First reference, spelled out.** Spell out term and append acronym in parenthesis.<br>*Correct examples:* content management system (CMS), Social Security Number (SSN)

* **Second reference format.** Replace term and use only acronym.<br>*Correct example:* "When you sign into the content management system (CMS), enter the new content into the CMS."

* **First reference, acronym only.** Some acronyms are used by themselves because they're better-known than their spelled-out terms. These acronyms are used on first reference.<br>*Correct examples:* DVD, ZIP Code, XML, API

### File-Type Formats

<ul>
<li>Do not use a period or other punctuation before or after the file name.<br><br>
<em>Examples:</em>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">

  <li><strong>No</strong> – “.pdf, .tiff, .html, .jpg, xss, .xml"</li>
  <li>Yes – “PDF, TIFF, HTML, JPG, CSS, XML”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Link format: Append the file type in parenthesis after the file name. For more details, see the [Labels Best Practices]({{ page.baseurl }}/design-styleguide/buttons-and-links-usage/buttons-and-links-usage.html#labels-best-practices) section in Buttons and Links Usage.</li>
</ul>

## Lists

Use a bulleted list when a sentence includes a series or especially when it includes a series of complex phrases or clauses.

Breaking up items in a series into lists will enhance readability for Magento users and enable them to better scan and find information.

Use these rules for lists:

* **Introducing a list.** All lists must be preceded by a lead-in heading, sentence or phrase, as follows:

  - A heading / title without punctuation

  - A sentence that ends in a colon or ellipsis

  - A phrase, or partial sentence, ending in a colon or ellipsis

* **Bullets vs. numbers.** Use bullets for non-sequential lists and numbers for sequential lists or instructions.

* **Capitalization.** Each item in a list should begin with a capitalized letter in the first word.

* **Periods.** Use for items that are complete sentences, wholly contained within the bullet / number. Can be used for bold lead-in content. See examples below.

* **Parallelism.** List elements should be constructed consistently. If the first item in a list is a noun, all items must be nouns. Similarly, if the first item is a sentence, all items must be sentences.
