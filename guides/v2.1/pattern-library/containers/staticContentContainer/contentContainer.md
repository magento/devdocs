#### 1. Parent and Child Containers

The following example, shows two sets of parent & child containers. Each parent containers has 2 children containers. There can be 1 or more children. 

It is not recommended to have more than one layer of parent-child (i.e. grand children are not recommended) But if there are exceptions made, the hierarchy should be shown clearly.

**Structure**

The parent container structure: title, rule, content.
