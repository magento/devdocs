Chuck:

You switch to the version upgraded server/cluster and then do a full reindex.  At that point you'll impact customers ( as there's no old working index ); so the merchant will be down for a while; then the index is done and everything is working correctly.

This would apply if the merchant is changing from Solr to Elasticsearch , or if the merchant is upgrading from ES 1.7 to ES 2.0 or ES 2.1 or some combination there off.

For the Elastic Config / Elastic Cluster configuration our ECG guy shave some experience there, might want to ping them to get their thoughts.
