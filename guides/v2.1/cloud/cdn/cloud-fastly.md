Fastly is a CDN based on Varnish caching, basically a cloud varnish service. When
working with Fastly, you are also working directly with a heavily customized version of Varnish (2.1). [Fastly](https://docs.fastly.com/){:target="_blank"}
with [Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/docs/){:target="_blank"} caches your
site pages, assets, CSS, and more in backend data centers you set up. As
customers access your site and stores, the requests hit Fastly to load cached
pages faster.

For {{site.data.var.ece}}, you receive Fastly CDN and DDoS services. When you
update products, catalogs, content, and more, Fastly purges that specific cached
content to refresh and provide the latest changes.

We provide Fastly service credentials including a Fastly Service ID and API key
pair for your Staging and Production environments. To
[set up Fastly](#install-configure), you enter credentials, upload VCL snippets,
and configure backends (with Origin shields) in Staging and Production
environments, not in Integration.

Fastly provides the following powerful tools for Magento:

* Create edge and ACL dictionaries with VCL snippets (Varnish 2.1 compliant) to
  modify how caching responds to requests

* Three types of purges for:

  * Quick Purge (by URL)
  * Surrogate/key purge using tags to purge specific HTML, images, categories, and so on
  * Purge all, which clears everything in the cache
* GeoIP extension support
* Force unencrypted requests over to TLS
* Image optimization support offloads image optimization to the Fastly service
  to speed up image delivery for your store

We highly recommend enabling and using Fastly for your caching and CDN. The only
situation where you might not want to enable Fastly is for a headless deployment.

We strongly recommend installing Fastly module 1.2.33 or later. If you want to
use the image optimization feature, you must use Fastly module version 1.2.52
or later.

## Fastly and 503 timeouts {#timeouts}

Fastly has a default 60 second time out. For Fastly module 1.2.22 and later,
the timeout for the Magento Admin is three minutes.

Any request processing that exceeds the timeout period,  returns a 503 error.
As a result, you might get 503 errors when attempting operations that require
lengthy processing, or when trying to perform bulk operations.

If you receive a 503 error, try to submit the request directly to the origin
shield URL and review logs to identify the source of the issue. For details,
see [Fastly troubleshooting]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/cdn/trouble-fastly.html#timeouts).

Fastly can be bypassed for the Magento Admin to perform long running or bulk actions and API access to avoid 503s. For Fastly module 1.2.22 and later, the timeout for the Magento Admin was extended to three minutes. You can also update the Fastly configuration for your store to [extend the Fastly timeout for the Magento Admin]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/cdn/configure-fastly.html#bulkaction).


## Backends and Origin shields {#backend}

Backend settings provide fine tuning for Fastly performance with Origin shielding
and timeouts. A _backend_ is a specific location (IP or domain) with configured
Origin shield and timeout settings for checking and providing cached content.

_Origin shielding_ routes all requests for your store to a specific Point of
Presence (POP). When a request is received, the POP checks for cached content
and provides it. If it is not cached, it continues to the Shield POP, then to
the Origin server which caches the content. The shields reduces traffic directly
to the origin.

We provide detailed instructions for configuring backends when you
[configure Fastly]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/cdn/configure-fastly.html).

## Basic authentication {#basic-auth}

Basic authentication is a feature to protect every page and asset on your site
with a username and password. We **do not recommend** activating basic
authentication on your Production environment. You can configure it on Staging
to protect your site when completing development.

If you add user access and enable basic authentication on Staging, you can still
access the Magento Admin without requiring additional credentials to enter.

## Custom VCLs and actions {#custom-vcl}

Fastly provides an extremely custom code friendly method for creating lists of
items like IPs and domains to complete actions via Fastly and Varnish code
blocks. For example, you can allow, block, or redirect access for specific users or IPs
using edge and ACL dictionaries and VCL code.

After you have [set up Fastly]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/cdn/configure-fastly.html),
you can create [custom VCL snippets]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/cdn/cloud-vcl-custom-snippets.html)
using these edge dictionaries and ACLs.

### Edge dictionaries {#dictionary}

Save key-value pairs on Fastly Edge nodes of dictionary containers and items to
invoke with VCL snippets in your site. You have up to 1,000 entries per
dictionary.

You create an edge dictionary then add items to it of a key and its value. For
example, you could create an edge dictionary of banned bad refer sites from
accessing your site. The key-value pairs would be the refer site URLs
(www.example.com) and a value of 1. Then create a custom VCL snippet to return
a 403 Forbidden to those sites when they access your site.

Another example routes to a different WordPress backend for an edge dictionary
of WordPress URLs.

### Edge ACLs {#acl}

ACLs are access control lists that allow you to manage IP addresses to allow or
block access to resources. You could use edge ACLs with VCL snippets to block IP
addresses or provide access. For example, use edge ACLs and a custom VCL snippet
to white list IPs to access your site.

### VCL snippets {#vcl}

With edge dictionaries and edge ACLs, you can create custom Varnish Configuration
Language (VCL) snippets to Fastly and your site. VCL snippets are small chunks
of logic and code that can be included directly into your service configuration.
They are generated, compiled, and transmitted to all Fastly caches, loaded, and
activated without waiting for maintenance windows without server downtime.

For a few examples, you can create VCL snippets to:

* Block access to the site using an edge dictionary of domains
* Whitelist and allow access using an edge ACL
* Redirect blog links from your store to a blog site
* Extend timeouts for Fastly and Magento

After you have [set up Fastly](#install-configure), we provide detailed
instructions on creating [custom Fastly VCL snippets]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/cdn/cloud-vcl-custom-snippets.html).

## Force TLS {#tls}

Fastly supports forcing unencrypted requests to TLS through the Force TLS
feature. Set up a secure base URL in Magento and turn on the Force TLS option
in the Fastly extension. For details and instructions, see the Fastly [Force TLS guide](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/blob/master/Documentation/Guides/FORCE-TLS.md){:target="_blank"}.

## GeoIP service support {#geoip}

Fastly provides a GeoIP service and supports some GeoIP functionality. GeoIP
handling manages visitor redirection (automatically) and store matching
(select from list) based on their obtained country code. For more information,
see the Fastly [GeoIP documentation](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/blob/21b61c8189971275589219d418332798efc7db41/Documentation/CONFIGURATION.md#geoip-handling){:target="_blank"}.

## Image Optimization support

Fastly image optimization (Fastly IO) provides real-time image manipulation and
optimization to speed up image delivery and simplify maintenance of image
source sets for responsive web applications. Fastly IO provides
the following image optimization features:

- Force lossy conversion
- Deep image optimization
- Adaptive pixel ratios

You must set up your Fastly service and configure the Origin shield before you
can enable and configure the Fastly IO option. See [Configure Fastly image optimization]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/cdn/fastly-image-optimization.html).

## Installation and configuration {#install-configure}

The installation and configuration process is:

* Install the Fastly module in an Integration branch, without configuring
settings or entering credentials.
* Deploy the code to `integration` then to Staging and Production
* Configure Fastly in Staging and Production, not in Integration or your local
* Test Fastly for caching

For instructions, see [Set up Fastly]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/cdn/configure-fastly.html).
After you have configured it, you can continue with advanced options including
custom VCL snippets.
