## Overview of redirection {#cloud-route-redir}

Managing redirection rules is a common requirement for web applications,
especially in cases where you do not want to lose incoming links that have
changed or been removed over time. This topic discusses how you can manage redirection rules on your
{{site.data.var.ece}} projects.

If the redirection methods discussed in this topic don't work for you, you can use caching headers to do the same thing.

## Whole-route redirects {#cloud-route-whole}

Using whole-route redirects, you can define very basic routes in `routes.yaml`. For example, you can redirect from a naked domain to a `www` subdomain as follows:

	http://{default}/:
	    type: redirect
	    to: http://www.{default}/

## Partial redirects {#cloud-route-partial}

In the [`.magento/routes.yaml`]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/project/project-conf-files_routes.html) file you can also add partial {% glossarytooltip 510de766-1ebd-4546-bf38-c618c9c945d2 %}redirect{% endglossarytooltip %} rules
to existing routes:

	http://{default}/:
	  # [...]
	  redirects:
	    expires: 1d
	    paths:
	      "/from": { "to": "http://example.com/" }
	      "/regexp/(.*)/matching": { "to": "http://example.com/$1", regexp: true }

This format is more rich and works with any type of route, including routes served directly by the application.

Two keys are available under `redirects`:

 * `expires`: Optional, the duration that the redirect is cached.
 Examples of valid values include `3600s`, `1d`, `2w`, `3m`.
 * `paths`: The paths to apply the redirects to.

Each rule under `paths` is defined by:

* A key that describes the expression to match against the
request path
* A value object describing both the destination to redirect to with
detail on how to handle the redirection.

  The value object is defined with the following
keys:

*   [`to`](#cloud-route-partial-to)
*   [`regexp`](#cloud-route-partial-regexp)
*   [`prefix`](#cloud-route-partial-prefix)
*   [`append_suffix`](#cloud-route-partial-append)
*   [`code`](#cloud-route-partial-code)

### `to` {#cloud-route-partial-to}
Required, a partial (`"/destination"` or `"//destination"`) or full URL (`"http://example.com/"`).

### `regexp` {#cloud-route-partial-regexp}
Optional, defaults to `false`. Specifies whether the path key should be interpreted as
   a PCRE regular expression.

In the following example, a request to `http://example.com/regexp/a/b/c/match` redirects to `http://example.com/a/b/c`:

```yaml
http://{default}/:
    type: upstream
    redirects:
       paths:
          "/regexp/(.*)/match":
          to: "http://example.com/$1"
          regexp: true
```

{% endcollapsible %}

### `prefix` {#cloud-route-partial-prefix}
Specifies whether or not to redirect both the path and all its children or just the path itself. Defaults to `true`, but is not supported if `regexp` is `true`.

{% collapsible Click to show/hide content %}

For example,

```yaml
http://{default}/:
    type: upstream
       redirects:
       paths:
          "/from":
          to: "http://{default}/to"
          partial: true
```

In the preceding example, if `partial` is set to `true`, `/from` redirects to `/to` and `/from/another/path` will redirect to `/to/another/path`

If `partial` is set to `false`, `/from` triggers a redirect, but `/from/another/path` does not.

{% endcollapsible %}

### `append_suffix` {#cloud-route-partial-append}
Determines if the suffix is carried over with the redirect. Defaults to `true`, but not supported if `regexp` is `true` *or* if `prefix` is `false`.

{% collapsible Click to show/hide content %}

For example,

```yaml
http://{default}/:
    type: upstream
    redirects:
       paths:
          "/from":
          to: "http://{default}/to"
          append_suffix: false
```

The preceding example results in `/from/path/suffix` redirecting to just `/to`.

If `append_suffix` is set to its default value of `true`, `/from/path/suffix` redirects to `/to/path/suffix`.

{% endcollapsible %}

### `code` {#cloud-route-partial-code}
Specifies the HTTP status code. Valid status codes are [`301` (Moved Permanently)](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.2){:target="_blank"}, [`302`](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.3){:target="_blank"}, [`307`](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.8){:target="_blank"}, and [`308`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7238){:target="_blank"}. Defaults to `302`.

### `expires` {#cloud-route-partial-expires}
Optional, the duration the redirect will be cached. Defaults to the `expires` value defined directly under the `redirects` key, but at this level we can fine-tune the expiration of individual partial redirects:

```yaml
http://{default}/:
    type: upstream
    redirects:
       expires: 1d
       paths:
          "/from": { "to": "http://example.com/" }
          "/here": { "to": "http://example.com/there", "expires": "2w" }
```

In the preceding example, redirects from `/from` expire in one day, but redirects from `/here` expire in two weeks.
