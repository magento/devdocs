The Upgrades and patches section contains detailed release notes for the ece-tools, and information on how to upgrade the ece-tools package, upgrade {{site.data.var.ece}}, and apply custom patches and hotfixes.

{{site.data.var.ece}} checks for pending patches and updates whenever you push code changes to the remote environment.

Some restrictions in the core {{site.data.var.ee}} code base prevent you from upgrading to the new application architecture directly, so use the following table to determine your upgrade path:

| Current Version | Upgrade Path |
| --- | --- |
| 2.1.3 and earlier | You must upgrade to version 2.1.4 or later before you continue. |
| 2.1.4 and later | You can begin the upgrade to [ece-tools 2002.0.9]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/release-notes/cloud-tools.html#v200209) and later. |
| 2.2.x | You can begin the upgrade to [ece-tools 2002.0.8]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/release-notes/cloud-tools.html#v200208) and later. |

We combined the upgrade metapackages for tools and patches with the release of [ece-tools version 2002.0.8](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/cloud/release-notes/cloud-tools.html#v200208) to simplify the process for future updates.
