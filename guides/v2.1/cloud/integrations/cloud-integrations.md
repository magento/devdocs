Integrations are useful for leveraging the functionality of the hosting services and maintaining your current development processes, such as using the code review pull request function in GitHub. Your {{site.data.var.ece}}  project can integrate with the following git-based hosting services:

-  [Bitbucket]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/integrations/bitbucket-integration.html)
-  [GitHub]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/integrations/github-integration.html)
<!-- -  [GitLab]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/integrations/gitlab-integration.html) -->

It is highly recommended to use _private_ repositories, as opposed to public.
