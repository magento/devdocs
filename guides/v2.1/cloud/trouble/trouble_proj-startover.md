## Resolve issues with a new project
This topic discusses solutions to typical issues you might experience with a new project.

### Project has no code yet {#cloud-trouble-nocode}
If you didn't push code to the project because, for example, you didn't complete the setup wizard, the following message displays next to the project name:

![If the project has no code]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_trouble_no-code.png)

Click the **This project has no code yet** link next to the project name to start the wizard again and see [First-time setup]({{ site.gdeurl21 }}cloud/access-acct/first-time-setup.html#cloud-first-email).
