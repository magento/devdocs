## Incorrect credentials

This topic discusses how to resolve issues with incorrect credentials in your `auth.json`. You might have entered {{site.data.var.ce}} credentials or shared keys for {{site.data.var.ee}}.

### Symptom

The most common symptom of incorrect credentials is a deployment failure with an authentication error similar to the following:

	The 'https://repo.magento.com/archives/magento/magento-cloud-configuration/magento-magento-cloud-configuration-1.0.3.0.zip' URL could not be accessed: HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

To see the error log:

1.	[Log in to your project]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/project/project-webint-basic.html#project-access).
2.	Click **Failure** to view the log as the following figure shows.

	![View the log for a failed deployment]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud_deploy-failure-creds.png){:width="600px"}

### Solution

To resolve this issue, you must clone the project locally and update `auth.json` with the correct {{site.data.var.ee}} [authorization keys]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html) and run `composer update` to update project dependencies. After that, you can deploy your project successfully and get started with your development.

Make sure you're using your own keys, and *not* [shared account keys](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/magento/magento-account-share.html){:target="_blank"}.

#### Get started

To get started:

1.	Log in to the machine on which your SSH keys are located.
2.	Log in to your project:

		magento-cloud login
3.	List your projects:

		magento-cloud project:list
4.	If necessary, clone a project.

		magento-cloud project:get <project ID>
4.	Change to a project directory.

	For example if your project is named Magento 2, `cd magento-2`

#### Update `auth.json` and redeploy the environment

To resolve the issue with credentials:

1.	If you haven't done so already, change to the project root directory.
2.	Open `auth.json` in a text editor.
3.	Change the value of `username` to your {{site.data.var.ee}} public key.
4.	Change the value of `password` to your {{site.data.var.ee}} private key.
5.	Save your changes to `auth.json` and exit the text editor.
6.	Update project dependencies:

		composer update
6.	Add, commit, and push your changes:

		git add -A
		git commit -m "<message>"
		git push origin master
7.	Wait for the project to deploy.
