The {{site.data.var.ece}} Pro plan includes a single, Git repository with a Global Master and three, main environments: the Integration environment for development and testing, the Staging environment for testing with all services, and the Production environment to go live. See [Pro architecture]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/architecture/pro-architecture.html) for an overview.

The following graphic demonstrates the Pro develop and deploy workflow, which uses a simple, git-branching approach. You [develop](#develop) code using an Active branch based on the Integration environment branch, _pushing_ and _pulling_ code changes to and from your remote, Active branch. You deploy verified code by _merging_ the remote branch to the base branch, which activates an automated [build and deploy](#deploy) process for that environment.

## Development workflow {#develop}

The Integration environment provides a single, base `integration` branch containing your {{site.data.var.ece}} code. You can create up to four additional branches for developing your custom code, extensions, and third party integrations. This allows for a maximum of five _active_ branches deployed to Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) containers.

The {{site.data.var.ece}} environments support a flexible, continuous integration process. Begin by cloning the `integration` branch to your local project folder. Create a new branch, or multiple branches, to develop new features, configure changes, add extensions, and deploy updates:

-  **Fetch** changes from `integration`
-  **Branch** from `integration`
-  **Develop** code on local workstation
-  **Push** code changes to remote and validate
-  **Merge** to `integration` and test

With a developed code branch and the corresponding configuration files, your code changes are ready to merge to the `integration` branch for more comprehensive testing. The Integration environment is also best for:

-  **Integrating third party services**—Not all services are available in the PaaS environment.
-  **Generating configuration management files**—Some configuration settings are _Read Only_ in a deployed environment.
-  **Configuring your store**—You should fully configure all store settings using the Integration environment. You can find the **Store Admin URL** on the _Integration_ environment panel in the _Project Web Interface_.

## Deployment workflow {#deploy}

Every time you push code from your local workstation to the remote environment or merge code to a base environment branch, the build and deploy scripts generate new Magento code and provision configured services to the remote environment.

Build script actions:

-  Site in the target environment continues to run during a build
-  Check and run {{site.data.var.ece}} patches and hotfixes
-  Compile code with a build and deploy log
-  Check for Configuration Management, static content deploy occurs during this phase
-  Create or use a slug of unchanged code to speed up the process
-  Provision all backend services and applications

Deploy script actions:

-  Place site in the target environment in a _Maintenance_ mode
-  Deploy static content if not completed during Build
-  Install or update {{site.data.var.ece}}
-  Configure routing for traffic

After the build and deploy process, your store comes back online with your latest code changes and configurations. See [Deployment process]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/reference/discover-deploy.html).

### Merge to Integration

Combine all verified code changes by merging your Active development branch into the base `integration` branch. You can test all your changes on the `integration` branch before promoting changes to the Staging environment.

### Merge to Staging

Staging is a pre-production environment that provides all services and settings as close to the Production environment as possible. You should always push your code changes in iterations to your Staging environment for full testing that includes all services. The first time you use the Staging environment, you must configure services, such as [Fastly CDN]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/basic-information/cloud-fastly.html), [Blackfire Profiler]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/project/project-integrate-blackfire.html), and [New Relic APM]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/project/new-relic.html). Also, we recommend configuring payment gateways, shipping, notifications, and other vital services with sandbox or testing credentials.

It is best to thoroughly test every service, verify your performance testing tools, and perform UAT testing as an administrator and as a customer, until you feel that your store is ready for the Production environment. See [Deploy your store]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/live/stage-prod-live.html).

### Merge to Production

After thorough testing in the Staging environment, merge to the Production environment and thoroughly test using live credentials. The moment you go live, customers must be able to complete purchases and administrators must be able to manage the live store. We provide a detailed, clear walk-through for deploying your store and going live:

-  See [Deploy your store]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/live/stage-prod-live.html)
-  See [Go live and launch]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/live/live.html)

### Merge to Global Master

You should always push a copy of the Production code to the Global Master in case there is an emergent need to debug the Production environment without interrupting services.

Do **not** create a branch from Global Master. Use the `integration` branch to create new, active branches for development and fixes.
