The Magento Cloud CLI is the utility for managing Magento Cloud projects and environments, which implements many features of the Project Web UI and more. This utility provides an advanced management interface for developers, DevOps and system administrators, for doing routines and automation tasks. You can install and use this utility for all {{site.data.var.ece}} Starter and Pro Integration environments. You cannot use these commands for the Pro Staging and Production environments which aren't listed in the cloud UI.

You can install the Magento Cloud CLI when setting up your local environment for development:

* [Install Magento prerequisites]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/before/before-workspace-magento-prereqs.html)
* [Enable SSH keys]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/before/before-workspace-ssh.html)

#### To list all available commands:

```bash
magento-cloud list
```

Magento designed these commands to manage Cloud Integration environments. It is a best practice to run the Magento Cloud CLI from a project directory, because you can omit the `-p <project ID>` parameter. 

#### To log in to a project:

```bash
magento-cloud login
```

#### To clone a project to a directory:

```bash
magento-cloud project:get <PROJECT_ID> <DIRECTORY> -e <ENVIRONMENT_ID>
```

If you want to clone the `master` environment, omit the `-e <ENVIRONMENT_ID>` parameter.

#### To list the environments in the current project:

```bash
magento-cloud environment:list
```

The `magento-cloud environment:list` command displays environment hierarchies, whereas `git branch` does not. If you have any nested environments, use the `magento-cloud environment:list` command.

## Git commands

You may notice that some of these commands are similar to Git commands. The `magento-cloud` Git commands directly connect to the Magento Git-based Cloud project with additional features. For example, when you push a Git branch, it is not activated until you access GitHub. The Magento CLI command includes activation.

#### To push an empty commit and force a redeployment:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "redeploy" && git push <BRANCH_NAME>
```

Some actions, such as adding a user, do not result in deployment.

#### To create a new branch:

```bash
magento-cloud environment:branch <NAME> <PARENT_BRANCH>
```

## Environment commands

The environment _name_ is different from the environment _ID_ only if you use spaces or capital letters in the environment name. An environment ID consists of all lowercase letters, numbers, and allowed symbols. Capital letters in an environment name are converted to lowercase in the ID; spaces in an environment name are converted to dashes.

An environment name _cannot_ include characters reserved for your Linux shell or for regular expressions. Forbidden characters include curly braces (`{ }`), parentheses, asterisk (`*`), angle brackets (`< >`), ampersand (`&`), percent (`%`), and other characters.

#### To check out an existing environment:

```bash
magento-cloud environment:checkout <ENVIRONMENT_ID>
```

#### To redeploy the environment:

Trigger a redeployment without using a push. You must verify and confirm the environment to redeploy. Do not use redeploy if there is a build in a pending state. 

```bash
magento-cloud environment:redeploy
Are you sure you want to redeploy the environment <environment_name>? [Y/n]
```

#### To merge changes from environment to parent:

```bash
magento-cloud environment:merge -p <PROJECT_ID> -e <ENVIRONMENT_ID>
```

#### To synchronize with parent:

```bash
magento-cloud environment:synchronize -p <PROJECT_ID> -e <ENVIRONMENT_ID> {code|data}
```

#### To list variables for this environment:

```bash
magento-cloud variable:list
```

#### To set a value for an environment variable:

```bash
magento-cloud variable:set <VARIABLE_NAME> <VARIABLE_VALUE>
```

## Common commands 

The listed commands are for Magento Cloud CLI version 1.11.1 and later.

## Update Magento Cloud CLI

The Magento Cloud CLI checks for available updates upon login, but you can also check for updates using the `self:update` command. If there is an update available, follow the instructions and enter `Y` for _yes_ to update the CLI.

If your Magento Cloud CLI is up to date, you see the following response:

```bash
magento-cloud update
```

```terminal
Checking for Magento Cloud CLI updates (current version: X.XX.X)
No updates found
```
