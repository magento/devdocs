{{site.data.var.ece}}, formerly Enterprise Cloud Edition, is a managed and automated hosting platform for Magento specifically created for Cloud infrastructures. This version combines {{site.data.var.ee}}, Cloud infrastructure hosting, with a few differences and added features, including Git integration and key environments for development, staging, and live production. You can code, test, and deploy across Integration, Staging, and Production environments for _continuous integration_ of your store.

Each {{site.data.var.ece}} plan includes an Integration environment for development, testing, and integrating services. Additional active environments are available at additional cost.

Cloud plans include:

-   Active Git branches of code.
-   Unlimited number of *inactive* Git branches.
-   Robust {% glossarytooltip d85e2d0a-221f-4d03-aa43-0cda9f50809e %}Composer{% endglossarytooltip %} build process.
-   And the option to add fully managed services like MySQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, RabbitMQ, and so on, without requiring external add-ons.

The {{site.data.var.ece}} architectures use the following technologies:

-   Git
-   Composer
-   Secure Shell (SSH)
-   MySQL (including command-line interaction)
