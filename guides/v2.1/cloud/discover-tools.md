## Tooling
Our job is to make developers and teams more productive, so we spent a lot of
time not only in making Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition a very robust hosting environment but also
a very easy one to use.

### Command-line interface (CLI)
We offer a feature-rich CLI that allows you to manage and automate every aspect
of Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition. 

### Web Interface
You can configure most aspects of Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition using our Web Interface
Even a non-technical user can create new environments,  can set up
access control, map domains. and manage users.

A project manager could use Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition without ever using the CLI.

### Git
Everything in Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition is managed using a Git repository. You can simply modify a couple
of configuration files and manage almost all aspects of operations that way.

### Seamless Bitbucket and GitHub integrations
We have perfectly seamless integrations for both Bitbucket and Github. You can
log in to Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition with your Bitbucket or Github account. And you can have
Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition environments be automatically created for every pull-request or 
branch you create and get feedback on deployments right there without 
switching tools.
