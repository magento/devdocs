After you install the Magento Cloud CLI and set up SSH keys for remote access to your Cloud infrastructure, you can use Magento Cloud CLI commands to manage the environments for your {{site.data.var.ece}} projects. For information about the environment architecture, see [Starter architecture]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/basic-information/starter-architecture.html) or [Pro architecture]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/basic-information/pro-architecture.html).

To manage the branches and environments with the Project Web Interface, see [Manage branches with the Project Web Interface]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/project/project-webint-branch.html).

## Common Magento Cloud CLI commands {#env-start-comm}

Magento Cloud CLI commands are very similar to Git commands. You can use them to connect to your {{site.data.var.ece}} project and manage your  {{site.data.var.ece}} environments. Although you can run the commands from any directory, we recommend that you run them from a project directory. When run from a project directory, you can omit the `-p <project-ID>` parameter.

The following list of commonly used Magento Cloud CLI commands includes required options only. Use the ``--help``
option with any command to get more detailed information. 

Command | Description
--- | ---
`git commit --allow-empty -m "redeploy" && git push <branch-name>` | Push an empty commit to force a redeployment. Some actions, such as adding a user, do not result in deployment.
`magento-cloud login` | Log in to the project.
`magento-cloud project:get <project-ID> <directory> -e <environment-ID>` | Clone a project to a directory. To clone the `master` environment, omit `-e <environment-ID>`.
`magento-cloud environment:list -p <project-ID>` | List the environments in the current project.
`magento-cloud environment:branch <name> <parent-branch>` | Create a new branch with a name and an ID. This information corresponds to the environment.
`magento-cloud environment:checkout <environment-ID>` | Check out an existing environment.
`magento-cloud environment:merge -p <project-ID> -e <environment ID>` | Merge changes in this environment with its parent.
`magento-cloud environment:synchronize -p <project-ID> -e <environment-ID> {code|data}` | Synchronize (`git pull`) code and data from the parent to this environment.
`magento-cloud variable:list` | List variables in this environment.
`magento-cloud variable:set <name> <value>` | Set a value for an environment variable.

For a full list of commands, see the [Magento Cloud CLI reference]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/reference/cli-ref-topic.html).

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
The environment _name_ is different from the environment _ID_ only if you use spaces or capital letters in the environment name. An environment ID consists of all lowercase letters, numbers, and allowed symbols. Capital letters in an environment name are converted to lowercase in the ID; spaces in an environment name are converted to dashes. An environment name _cannot_ include characters reserved for your Linux shell or for regular expressions. Forbidden characters include curly braces (`{ }`), parentheses, asterisk (`*`), angle brackets (`< >`), ampersand (`&`), percent (`%`), and other characters.

## Get started creating branches {#getstarted}

To begin, create a new branch.

{% include cloud/cli-get-started.md %}

## Merge a branch {#merge}

After completing development, you can merge this branch to the parent:

1.  Complete code in your local branch.

1.  Add, commit, and push changes to the environment.

    ```bash
    git add -A && git commit -m "Commit message" && git push origin <branch-name>
    ```

1.  Merge with the parent environment:

    ```bash
    magento-cloud environment:merge <environment-ID>
    ```

## Delete an environment {#env-delete}

Only delete an environment if you are certain that you no longer need it. You cannot recover an environment after you delete it.

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-warning}
You cannot delete the `master` environment of any project.

You must be a [project administrator]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/project/user-admin.html#cloud-role-project), [environment administrator]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/project/user-admin.html#cloud-role-env), or [Project Owner]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/project/user-admin.html#cloud-role-acct-owner) to perform this task.

When you delete an environment, the environment is set to _inactive_. The code is still available in the Git branch, but no longer contains the services or the database. To delete the environment completely, you must also delete the corresponding remote Git branch.

#### To delete an environment:

1.  Open a terminal and navigate to your project.

1.  Fetch updates from the remote server.

    ```bash
    git fetch
    ```

1.  Checkout the environment branch.

    ```bash
    magento-cloud environment:checkout <environment-ID>
    ```

1.  Respond to the prompts to delete the local environment and the corresponding remote environment.

    ```terminal
    The environment <environment-ID> is currently active: deleting it will delete all associated data.
    Are you sure you want to delete the environment <environment-ID>? [Y/n]
    ```

    Deleting the environment places it in an _inactive_ state.

    ```terminal
    Delete the remote Git branch too? [Y/n]
    ```

    Deleting the remote Git branch removes the environment from the project.

1.  Wait for the environment to delete.

    ```terminal
    Deleting environment <environment-ID>
    Waiting for the activity...
      Deleting environment <project-id>-<environment-ID>-xxxxxx
    
      [============================]  1 min (complete)
    Activity ID succeeded
    Deleted remote Git branch <environment-ID>
    Run git fetch --prune to remove deleted branches from your local cache.
    ```

#### To delete more than one environment:

You can delete more than one environment at a time by adding multiple environment IDs to the delete command.

```bash
magento-cloud environment:delete <environment-1-ID> <environment-2-ID>
```

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
To activate an inactive environment, use the `magento-cloud environment:activate` command.

## Integration environment IP addresses {#ipaddress}

The following table lists incoming and outgoing IP addresses used by {{site.data.var.ece}} [Integration environments]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/architecture/pro-architecture.html#cloud-arch-int). These IP addresses are stable, but might change. We always notify customers before making any IP address changes.

If you have a corporate firewall that blocks outgoing SSH connections, you can add the inbound IP addresses to your whitelist.

## Interact with environments via the Magento Cloud CLI {#commands}

After you [setup SSH keys]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/env/environments-ssh.html), you can connect from your local workspace to a remote environment and use Magento Cloud CLI commands to interact with your {{site.data.var.ece}} project services and modify settings.
