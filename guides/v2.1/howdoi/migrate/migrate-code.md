## Migrate code from Magento 1 to Magento 2

Custom code used by your Magento 1 store is compatible with Magento 2 in most cases. The code will require either rewriting or migrating. 

Magento offers {% glossarytooltip 610157a5-5054-41f5-994b-4eadf54786ec %}code migration{% endglossarytooltip %} tools that can help with this process. Note that due to platform differences, the migration output requires additional work to make sure it can be successfully installed in a Magento 2 store.
