## Overview

Some behavior and logic of Magento 1 has been implemented differently in Magento 2. The Data Migration Tool takes care of it. Although, there are some migration aspects you should know about, and sometimes you must take minor steps for some functionalities to work smoothly after migration.

## Information

### Split database not supported

The Data Migration Tool doesn't support split databases.

### Group Prices converted to Tier Prices

All Group Prices are automatically converted to Tier Prices during migration.

### New numbering for sales entities

Reference numbers for Orders, Invoices, Shipments, Credit Memos, and RMA migrate as is. But after migration, the new Magento 2 number assignment rules will apply. Thus, the numeration for the new sales entities will be different.

## Steps

### Resave Customer Segments [{{site.data.var.ee}} only]

After migration, Customer Segments must be resaved from the {% glossarytooltip 29ddb393-ca22-4df9-a8d4-0024d75739b1 %}Admin{% endglossarytooltip %} Panel to get them up and running.

### Configure time zone offset

If your Magento 1 server has the time zone set to anything other than UTC, you must configure the offset to migrate timestamp fields. To transform time to a different time zone, use the Data Migration Tool's `\Migration\Handler\Timezone` handler.

In the following example, the Magento 1 server timezone is UTC-7. To convert the customer account creation date properly, add the following rule to `map-customer.xml`:

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<map xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xs:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="../map.xsd">
  <!--...-->
  <destination>
      <field_rules>
          <!--...-->
          <transform>
              <field>customer_entity.created_at</field>
              <handler class="\Migration\Handler\Timezone">
                  <param name="offset" value="-7" />
              </handler>
          </transform>
      </field_rules>
  </destination>
</map>
{% endhighlight %}
