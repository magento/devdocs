You can upgrade Magento from the command line if you installed the software using any of the following:

* Downloaded the {% glossarytooltip 7490850a-0654-4ce1-83ff-d88c1d7d07fa %}metapackage{% endglossarytooltip %} using `composer create-project`
* Installed the compressed archive

 	<ul><li>If you cloned the Magento 2 GitHub repository, you <em>cannot</em> use this method to upgrade; instead, see <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/install/cli/dev_update-magento.html">Update the Magento application</a>.</li>
 		<li>If you configured Magento use use <code>pub</code> as its root directory, see the next section.</li>
 		<li>If you're upgrading to Magento 2.1 (including a Release Candidate) from Magento 2.0.7 or earlier <em>and</em> you installed sample data, see <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}/comp-mgr/cli/cli-rc1-samp.html">Command-line upgrade to Magento 2.1 with sample data</a> instead of this topic.</li></ul>

## Prerequisite: `pub` directory root {#upgrade-cli-pub}

This section applies to you *only* if you set the Magento root directory to `<your Magento install dir>/pub`.
If you did not do this, skip this section and continue with the next section.

If you use `pub/` as your Magento root directory:

* For the upgrade, create another subdomain or docroot that uses the Magento installation directory as its root.

  Run the [System Upgrade utility]({{ page.baseurl }}/comp-mgr/upgrader/upgrade-start.html) using that subdomain.
* Use the [following procedure](#upgrade-cli-upgr) to upgrade Magento using the command line.

## Put your store in maintenance mode {#upgrade-cli-maint}

To prevent access to your store while it's being upgraded, put your store in maintenance mode.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
  	<p>You can optionally create a <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}/comp-mgr/trouble/cman/maint-mode.html">custom maintenance mode page</a>.</p>
</div>

To enable maintenance mode:

1. Log in to your Magento server as, or switch to, the Magento file system owner.
2. Enable maintenance mode:
   ```bash
   php <your Magento install dir>/bin/magento maintenance:enable
   ```
   For additional options, see [Enable or disable maintenance mode]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-subcommands-maint.html).

## Upgrade using the command line {#upgrade-cli-upgr}

1. Log in to your Magento server as, or switch to, the Magento file system owner.
2. Change to the directory in which you installed the Magento software. For example,
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/html/magento2
   ```
3. Require the Magento package using Composer and update the dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer require <product> <version> --no-update
   ```
   ```bash
   composer update
   ```

   For example, to upgrade to {{ site.data.var.ce }} version {{ page.version }}.13, enter:
   ```bash
   composer require magento/product-community-edition {{ page.version }}.13 --no-update
   ```
   ```bash
   composer update
   ```
   To upgrade to {{ site.data.var.ee }} version {{ page.version }}.13, enter:
   ```bash
   composer require magento/product-enterprise-edition {{ page.version }}.13 --no-update
   ```
   ```bash
   composer update
   ```

3. If prompted, enter your [authentication keys]({{ page.baseurl }}/comp-mgr/prereq/prereq_auth-token.html).
4. Manually clear `var` subdirectories:

   ```bash
   rm -rf <Magento install dir>/var/cache/*
   ```
   ```bash
   rm -rf <Magento install dir>/var/page_cache/*
   ```
   ```bash
   rm -rf <Magento install dir>/var/generation/*
   ```

   <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" markdown="1">
   If you use a cache storage other than filesystem (e.g., Redis, Memcached, etc.) you need to manually clear the cache there too.
   </div>

4. Update the database schema and data:
   ```bash
    php bin/magento setup:upgrade
    ```
5. Put your storefront online (that is, cancel maintenance mode):
   ```bash
   php bin/magento maintenance:disable
   ```
6. Restart Varnish if you use it for page caching.
   ```bash
   service varnish restart
   ```

7. Access your storefront.

   The following error might display:
   ```terminal
   We're sorry, an error has occurred while generating this email.
   ```

   If so, perform the following tasks:

   1. Reset [file system ownership and permissions]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/prereq/file-system-perms.html) as a user with `root` privileges.
   2. Clear the following directories and try again:
      * `<your Magento install dir>/var/cache`
      * `<your Magento install dir>/var/page_cache`
      * `<your Magento install dir>/var/generation`
