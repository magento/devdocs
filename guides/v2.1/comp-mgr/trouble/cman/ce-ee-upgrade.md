### Problem: Error upgrading from CE to EE {#ce-ee}

Your upgrade from **{{site.data.var.ce}}** to **{{site.data.var.ee}}** might fail with the following error:

```terminal
	[2016-01-19 23:33:24 UTC] An error occurred while executing job 
	"setup:upgrade {"command":"setup:upgrade"}": Could not complete 
	setup:upgrade {"command":"setup:upgrade"} successfully: Source 
	class "\Cybersource" for "CybersourceLogger" generation does not exist.
```

If this error displays, resolve it as follows:

1.	Log in to your Magento server as the {% glossarytooltip 5e7de323-626b-4d1b-a7e5-c8d13a92c5d3 %}Magento file system owner{% endglossarytooltip %}.
2.	Enter the following commands in the order shown:

    ```bash
    php <magento_root>/bin/magento setup:upgrade
    ```

3.	After the command completes, verify your upgrade was successful:

    ```bash
    bin/magento --version
    ```
