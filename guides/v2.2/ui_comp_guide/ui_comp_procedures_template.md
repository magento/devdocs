#### Code blocks

By indenting your content by at least 4 spaces, you can create a code block.

    //This is a code block!
    print "Hello World!";

Code blocks can also be defined by surrounding the block of code with `~~~` which can be seen in the [table](#tables) example.

For highlighted code blocks use the `highlight` Liquid tag.

*Example:*

```html
<div class="container">
  <h4 class="title">Title</h4>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Paragraph content.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
