## Assign categories to shared catalog

This action works as an update. It does not replace companies that have already been assigned.

If a specified company is already assigned to a different shared catalog, this request unassigns the company from the previous catalog and assigns to the new one.

**Sample usage**

`POST /V1/sharedCatalog/2/assignCompanies`

**Payload**

{% highlight json %}

{
  "companies": [
    {
      "id": 1
    },
    {
      "id": 2
    }
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Response**

`true`, indicating the operation was successful

## Unassign categories from a shared catalog

When you unassign a company from a custom catalog, the system automatically assigns this company to the public shared catalog. You cannot unassign a company from the public catalog.

**Sample usage**

`POST /V1/sharedCatalog/2/unassignCompanies`

**Payload**

{% highlight json %}
{
  "companies": [
    {
      "id": 2
    }
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Response**

`true`, indicating the operation was successful

## List the shared catalog companies

The `GET` call returns an array of company IDs.

**Sample Usage**

`GET  /V1/sharedCatalog/2/companies`

**Payload**

Not applicable

**Response**

`"[\"1\",\"2\"]"`
