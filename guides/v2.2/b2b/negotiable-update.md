Sellers and buyers can edit a negotiable quote at various times during the quote's lifecycle. Both use the `PUT /V1/negotiableQuote/:quoteId` call to update the quote. This call is defined in the
`quoteCartRepositoryV1` service and is functionally similar to the
`PUT /V1/carts/mine` call.

The `quote` object now contains a set of `negotiable_quote` extension attributes that can be used to update a quote.

### Set a negotiated price

In every successful negotiate quote, the seller must set the negotiated price.

The `negotiated_price_type` can have one of the following values:

`1` - Apply a percentage discount to the quote. The `negotiated_price_value`parameter indicates the percentage.

`2` - Apply a fixed amount as a discount for the quote. The `negotiated_price_value`parameter specifies the amount of the discount.

`3` - Set a proposed price for the entire quote. The `negotiated_price_value`parameter specifies the proposed price.
