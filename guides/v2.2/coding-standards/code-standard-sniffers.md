We recommend the consistent use of a _code sniffer_ to enhance the readability of your code and help ensure that it meets Magento code standards.  A code sniffer is a tool that automates the process of identifying code irregularities. Although a sniffer will identify many more inconsistencies and errors than a manual edit, we recommend that you evaluate and make any fixes that your sniffer program identifies.

Magento recommends the use of [PHP_CodeSniffer]{:target="_blank"}, the most popular code sniffer in use throughout the {% glossarytooltip bf703ab1-ca4b-48f9-b2b7-16a81fd46e02 %}PHP{% endglossarytooltip %} development community.
PHP_CodeSniffer 1.4.0+ includes [PSR-1]{:target="_blank"} and [PSR-2]{:target="_blank"} standards, which are followed by Magento 2.
You can configure PHP_CodeSniffer to use your own rules, too. The [Magento Extension Quality Program Coding Standard][eqp]{:target="_blank"} provides specifications that you can use to configure your code sniffer of choice to bring your _PHP coding style closer to Magento PHP standards_.

## Rule set for the PHP_CodeSniffer

You can use our custom rule set with the code sniffer to be confident that your code meets all Magento-specific standards.

The rule set is located in [`dev/tests/static/framework/Magento/ruleset.xml`][ruleset.xml]{:target="_blank"}.
