Test cases in the Magento Functional Testing Framework (MFTF) are defined in XML as [`<tests>`].
`<tests>` is a [Codeception test container][Codeception] that contains multiple individual tests with test metadata and before and after actions.

MFTF `<tests>` is considered a sequence of actions with associated parameters.
Any failed [assertion] within a test constitutes a failed test.

{%
include note.html
type = "info"
content='`<before>` and `<after>` hooks are not global within `<tests>`.
They only apply to the `<test>` in which they are declared.

The steps in `<after>` are run in both successful **and** failed test runs.'

The following diagram shows the structure of an MFTF test case:

## Format

The format of `<tests>` is:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<tests xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="../../../../../../vendor/magento/magento2-functional-testing-framework/src/Magento/FunctionalTestingFramework/Test/etc/testSchema.xsd">
        <test name="" insertBefore="" insertAfter="">
            <annotations>
                <!-- TEST ANNOTATIONS -->
            </annotations>
            <before>
                <!-- ACTIONS AND ACTION GROUPS PERFORMED BEFORE THE TEST -->
            </before>
            <after>
                <!-- ACTIONS AND ACTION GROUPS PERFORMED AFTER THE TEST -->
            </after>
            <!-- TEST ACTIONS, ACTION GROUPS, AND ASSERTIONS-->
        </test>
    </tests>
</config>
```

## Principles

The following conventions apply to MFTF tests:

* All names within the framework are in the CamelCase format.
* `<test>` name must be alphanumeric.
* Each action and action group has its own identifier `<stepKey>` for reference purposes.
* A test may have any number of [assertions][assertion] at any point within the `<test>`.
* If `<test>` is included in `<suite>`, it **cannot be generated in isolation** to the rest of the contents of the suite (see [suites] for details).

Multiple `<test>` tags per XML file can make it hard to find and organize tags.
To simplify, we generate one `test.php` file per `<test>` tag provided, though we support both single and multiple `<test>` tags per XML file.

## Elements reference

There are several XML elements that are used in `<tests>` in the MFTF.

### tests {#tests-tag}

`<tests>` is a container for multiple tests. It is a group of test methods that define test flows within a test case.

`<tests>` must contain at least one [`<test>`].

### test {#test-tag}

`<test>` is a set of steps, including [actions] and [assertions][assertion]. It is a sequence of test steps that define test flow within a test method.


Attribute|Type|Use|Description
---|---|---|---
`name`|string|optional|The test identifier.
`remove`|boolean|optional|Set `true` to remove the test when merging.
`insertBefore`|string|optional| This option is used for [merging]. It enables you to add all test actions contained in the original test into a test with the same name BEFORE the test step with `stepKey` that you assigned in `insertBefore`.
`insertAfter`|string|optional| Set `stepKey` of the test step after which you want to insert the test when [merging].
`extends`|string|optional|A name of the parent test to [extend].

`<test>` may also contain [`<annotations>`], [`<before>`], [`<after>`], any [action][actions], or [`<actionGroup>`].

### annotations {#annotations-tag}

[Annotations] are supported by both [Codeception] and [Allure].

Codeception annotations typically provide metadata and are able to influence test selection.
Allure annotations provide metadata for reporting.

### before {#before-tag}

`<before>` wraps the steps to perform before the [`<test>`].

`<before>` may contain these child elements:

 * Any [`<action>`][actions]
 * [`<actionGroup>`]

### after {#after-tag}

`<after>` wraps the steps to perform after the [`<test>`].
The steps are run in both successful **and** failed test runs.

`<after>` may contain:

 * Any [`<action>`][actions]
 * [`<actionGroup>`]

### actionGroup {#actiongroup-tag}

`<actionGroup>` calls a corresponding [action group].

Attribute|Type|Use|Description
---|---|---|---
`ref`|string|required|References the required action group by its `name`.
`stepKey`|string|required| Identifies the element within `<test>`.
`before`|string|optional| `<stepKey>` of an action or action group that must be executed next while merging.
`after`|string|optional| `<stepKey>` of an action or action group that must be executed one step before the current one while merging.

`<actionGroup>` may contain [`<argument>`].

### argument {#argument-tag}

`<argument>` sets an argument that is used in the parent [`<actionGroup>`].

Attribute|Type|Use
---|---|---
`name`|string|optional| Name of the argument.
`value`|string|optional| Value of the argument.

See [Action groups][action group] for more information.
