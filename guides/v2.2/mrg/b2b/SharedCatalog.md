## Overview

The `Magento_SharedCatalog` modules defines the visibility of products as well as product prices in the catalog and in B2B quotes for different company accounts.

The module allows a merchant to create multiple shared catalogs, link them to one or more company accounts, and set different product prices. Shared catalogs also control the visibility of products and categories for a company in the storefront. The shared catalog type (public or custom) defines the scope of products and prices available for guest users vs logged-in users. The system can have only one public and any number of custom shared catalogs.

The module relies on the `CatalogPermissions` module, in that the visibility of categories for a customer group is defined by category permissions for this customer group. Once a shared catalog is enabled in B2B features, the category permissions are automatically enabled. Adding a product or a category to a shared catalog enables appropriate category permissions for the customer groups linked to this shared catalog.

The module provides web APIs and can be integrated with third-party solutions to manage shared catalogs in Magento.

## Installation details

The module heavily depends on the Magento_Company module, which must be installed and enabled the first. Category permissions must be enabled for shared catalogs to work properly. Price configuration for a shared catalog requires the start of a message queue consumer `sharedCatalogUpdatePrice`.

The module does not create any backward incompatible changes. Can be deactivated and uninstalled at any time.

When the module is uninstalled, the other <i>ProductType</i>SharedCatalog modules won't work.
