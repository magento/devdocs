We are pleased to present the Magento 2.2.0 CE, EE, and B2B Release Candidates 1 and 2. This QuickStart guide provides the basic information you need to start participating in our Magento 2.2.0 Release Candidate evaluation program.

This guide covers:

* **Welcome to the Magento 2.2.0 Release Candidate program and its requirements**

* **Install the Release Candidate code**

* **Submit comments on Magento 2.2.0 Release Candidate**

* **Readiness status of individual code components**. Magento 2.2.0 Release Candidate code is a work in progress. Parts of the code base are more mature than others. You can see an overview of component status here [Component Status]({{page.baseurl}}release-notes/release-candidate/component-status.html). Note that we will update this information each Friday of the Release evaluation period.

* **Magento test environments specification**.  See [Magento Release Candidate Testing Environments]({{page.baseurl}}release-notes/release-candidate/testing-environments.html) for a selection of these environments.


## Welcome to the Magento 2.2.0 Release Candidate

Magento 2.2.0 Release Candidate code is approaching production quality, but will include bugs and incomplete features. It does provide a snapshot of the current 2.2.0 codebase and consequently an early peek into the new features that 2.2.0 will provide in more robust form.


### Goals of this release

Participation in this Release Candidate evaluation has benefits for both community members and Magento.


#### Magento goals

Our primary goal for this release is to invite and receive community and partner feedback that will help us refine our 2.2.0 product code before GA. Specifically, we hope that participants in this Release Candidate evaluation can report on:

* **Functionality**. Keep in mind that this Release Candidate does not contain all the functionality that the 2.2.0 GA release will include.

* **Usability**. How do the features we've implemented for Release Candidate work in context of your typical workflows?

* **Code quality issues**. Are there particularly challenging processes or tasks that need improvement?

* **Feature gaps and enhancements**. Can you identify any steps within existing features that are missing, or enhancements that would improve features?



#### Participant goals

As community members and Partners, you have much to gain from participating in this release, too. Early access to this code provides you with the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the code and start training technical team members. Likewise, you can start planning  extension and custom code updates.



### Usage guidelines

Keep in mind the following features of this Release Candidate  during your evaluation:

* Release Candidate code is not production quality and will contain bugs. Report these bugs as GitHub issues, please!

* Release Candidate code is for testing and training only. Do not use Release Candidate Software for production deployments. Any sites developed with Release Candidate software will require significant reworking to accomodate future code updates.

* No technical support is available for problems you encounter during Release Candidate evaluation.

* You cannot share Release Candidate code with anyone external to your organization.



### Participants

How you participate in this evaluation depends upon which code base you'll be downloading and evaluating: CE, EE, and/or B2B.



#### CE Evaluation participants

We invite any Magento community member to participate in the Magento 2.2.0 CE Release Candidate evaluation.



#### EE and B2B Evaluation participants

The Magento 2.2.0 EE Release Candidate evaluation is open to all Solution Partners. To participate, you must:

* Sign the [Release Candidate Software agreement](https://magento.com/partners/portal/customer/account/login/referer/aHR0cHM6Ly9tYWdlbnRvLmNvbS9wYXJ0bmVycy9wb3J0YWwvYWdyZWVtZW50Lw,,/). Note that the Magento Primary Contact must sign the agreement.

* Provide GitHub account information for an Individual Account for a Solution Partner Employee. The company name field must contain the Partner’s name or @partnername. Alternatively, the user’s profile must show that the developer is a member of the Solution Partner’s GitHub Organization.
