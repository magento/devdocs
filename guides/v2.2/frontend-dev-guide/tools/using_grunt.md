The topic describes how to install and configure [Grunt JavaScript task runner](http://gruntjs.com/).

## Overview

You can use Grunt to automate any tasks you need, but out of the box Magento comes with pre-configured grunt tasks for compiling LESS files.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you [set]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-mode.html) your Magento application to the developer or default [mode]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/bootstrap/magento-modes.html).

## Installing and configuring Grunt {#grunt_prereq}

Magento has built-in Grunt tasks configured, but there are still several steps you need to take to be able to use it:

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to any location on your machine.

1. Install Grunt CLI tool globally. To do this, run the following command in a command prompt:

    ```bash
    npm install -g grunt-cli
    ```

1. From the `<Magento_root>` directory, copy and paste the contents of the following files:

   -  `package.json.sample` into `package.json`
   -  `Gruntfile.js.sample` into `Gruntfile.js`
   -  `grunt-config.json.sample` into `grunt-config.json`

1. Install (or refresh) the `node.js` project dependency, including Grunt, for your Magento instance. To do this, run the following commands in a command prompt:

    ```bash
    cd your_Magento_instance_directory
    npm install
    npm update
    ```

1. (Optional) If you want to use Grunt for "watching" changes automatically, without reloading pages in a browser each time, install the [LiveReload extension](http://livereload.com/extensions/) in your browser.

## Grunt configuration file {#grunt_config}

Copy the contents of `themes.js` into `local-themes.js` in the `dev/tools/grunt/configs/` directory.

If installed as described above, Grunt will use the default configuration files located in the `dev/tools/grunt/configs/` directory. You can define your theme in the `local-themes.js` file. The following shows an example of how you can define your theme.

```javascript
<theme>: {
  area: '<area>',
  name: '<Vendor>/<theme>,
  locale: '<language>',
  files: [
    '<path_to_file1>', //path to root source file
    '<path_to_file2>'
  ],
dsl: 'less'
}
```

Where the following notation is used:

-  `<Vendor>`: vendor name.
-  `<theme>`: your theme code, conventionally should correspond to the theme directory name.
-  `<area>`: area code, can be either `frontend` or `adminhtml`.
-  `<language>`: specified in the `code_subtag` format, for example `en_US`. Only one locale can be specified here. To debug the theme with another locale, create one more theme declaration, having specified another value for `language`.
-  `<path_to_file>`: path to the root source file, relative to the `app/design/frontend/<Vendor>/<theme>/web` directory. You need to specify all [root source files of the theme]({{ page.baseurl }}/frontend-dev-guide/css-topics/css-preprocess.html#css_preprocess_terms). If your theme [inherits] from a certain theme, and does not contain its own root source files, specify the root source files of the parent theme.

## Using custom Grunt configuration files

There are several ways to declare a custom configuration file.

### How to declare custom config file: Option 1

To use a custom file for Grunt configuration:

1. Copy the default configuration file to the preferred location in the Magento instance directory. Do not change the file name
1. Open the `grunt-config.json` file in the Magento root and set configurations object as follows.

   -  key: file alias
   -  value: path to your custom file

   Example:
   If your custom configuration file `local-themes.js` is located in the `<magento_root>/dev/tools/grunt/configs` directory, the following is already set in your `grunt-config.json`:

   ```config
   {
       "themes": "dev/tools/grunt/configs/local-themes"
   }
   ```

This path is also added to your .gitignore by default.

### How to declare custom configuration file: Option 2

You can also use the other way to declare a custom config file:

1. In your Grunt related scripts, in the file router set the alias and path to the default configuration file. For example, for the `themes.js` configuration file this would look like following:

   ```config
   filesRouter.set('themes', 'dev/tools/grunt/configs/themes');
   ```

   It must be added earlier, than the `get()` method with this alias is called.

1. In the `dev/tools/grunt/configs/` directory, create a copy of the default configuration file. Change its name by adding the ".loc" suffix. For example, your copy of `themes.js` will be `themes.loc.js`.

### How to use custom configuration file

To tell Grunt to use a custom configuration file, instead of the default one, add the following in your script:

1. Require file-router:

   ```config
   var fileRouter = require('/files-router');
   ```

1. Call the `get(%file_alias%)` method to get the configuration file.

   ```config
   var themes = fileRouter.get('themes');
   ```
