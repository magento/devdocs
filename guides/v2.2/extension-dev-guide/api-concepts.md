## What is a public interface? {#public-interface}

A _public interface_ is a set of code that third-party developers can call, implement, or build as a [plug-in](https://glossary.magento.com/plug-in). Magento guarantees that this code will not change in subsequent releases without a major version change.

Public interfaces for a [module](https://glossary.magento.com/module) are marked with `@api` annotation.

Third-party developers should use only these interfaces, that is, interfaces with the `@api` annotation. You can use other interfaces but those may be modified or removed in subsequent Magento releases. For more information, see [Backward compatibility]({{ page.baseurl }}/contributor-guide/backward-compatible-development/).

## What is an API? {#api-definition}

An application programming interface (API) is a set of interfaces and their implementations that a module provides to other modules.

### API types {#api-types}

The following items are considered types of APIs:

-  Directory structure
-  Configuration files structure
-  Events
-  Client API
-  Provider [API](https://glossary.magento.com/api) (SPI)

Directory structure and configuration file structure are types of APIs because [extension](https://glossary.magento.com/extension) developers use them. Developers write configurations, and place their [static files](https://glossary.magento.com/static-files) in specified folders; so if the configuration file structure or directory structure changes in subsequent releases, modules and extensions may break.
