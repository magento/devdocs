The deployment process begins when you perform a merge, push, or synchronization of your environment, or when you trigger a [manual redeployment]({{page.baseurl}}/cloud/reference/cli-ref-topic.html#git-commands). The deployment process takes time, but there are ways to optimize deployment that depend on whether you are developing and testing or working with a live site. Most notably, you can control the [static content deployment]({{page.baseurl}}/cloud/deploy/static-content-deployment.html).

There are three, distinct phases of the deployment process: build, deploy, and post-deploy. Each phase performs specific actions with limited resources:

## ![Build phase] Build phase

The _build_ phase assembles containers for the services defined in the configuration files, installs dependencies based on the `composer.lock` file, and runs the build hooks defined in the `.magento.app.yaml` file. Without the ability to connect to any services or access the database, the build phase depends on the resources limited to the environment.

## ![Deploy phase] Deploy phase

The _deploy_ phase places a temporary hold on incoming requests and transitions the site to [maintenance mode]({{page.baseurl}}/config-guide/bootstrap/magento-modes.html). The deploy phase uses the new containers and, after mounting the file system, opens network connections, activates the services defined in the `relationships` section of the `.magento.app.yaml` file, and runs the deploy hooks defined in the `.magento.app.yaml` file. Everything is _read only_, except for directories defined in the `.magento.app.yaml` file. By default, the [`mounts` property]({{page.baseurl}}/cloud/project/project-conf-files_magento-app.html#mounts) includes the following directories:

-  `app/etc`—contains the `env.php` and `config.php` configuration files
-  `pub/media`—contains all media data, such as Magento products or categories
-  `pub/static`—contains generated static files
-  `var`—contains temporary files created during Magento runtime

All other directories have read-only permissions. The new site becomes active at the end of the deploy phase as it transitions out of maintenance mode and releases the temporary hold on incoming requests.

## ![Post-deploy phase] Post-deploy phase

The _post-deploy_ phase runs the post-deploy hooks defined in the `.magento.app.yaml` file. Performing any action on this phase can affect site performance; however, you can use the [WARM_UP_PAGES]({{page.baseurl}}/cloud/env/variables-post-deploy.html#warm_up_pages) environment variable to populate the cache.

## ![Verify state] Verify configurations

You can test the optimal configuration for the state of your project by running the [Smart wizards]({{page.baseurl}}/cloud/deploy/smart-wizards.html).
