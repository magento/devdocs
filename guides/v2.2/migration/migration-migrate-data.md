## Before you start: routine preparations

1. Log in to Magento server as [the file system owner]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/prereq/file-sys-perms-over.html).

2. Change to the Magento installation directory or make sure it is added to your system PATH.

See the [First steps]({{ page.baseurl }}/migration/migration-migrate.html#migration-command-run-first) section for more details.

## Run the data migration command {#migrate-data-cmd}

To start migrating data, run:

    bin/magento migrate:data [-r|--reset] [-a|--auto] {<path to config.xml>}

where:

* `[-a|--auto]` is an optional argument that prevents migration from stopping when it encounters integrity check errors.

* `[-r|--reset]` is an optional argument that starts migration from the beginning. You can use this argument for testing migration.

* `{<path to config.xml>}` is the absolute file system path to `config.xml`; this argument is required

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
The Data Migration Tool saves its current progress as it runs. If errors or user intervention stop it from running, the Tool resumes progress at the last known good state.
To force the Data Migration Tool to run from the beginning, use the `--reset` argument. In that case, we recommend you restore your Magento 2 database dump to prevent duplicating previously migrated data.

## Possible consistency errors {#migrate-command-data}

While running, the Data Migration Tool may report inconsistencies between Magento 1 and Magento 2 databases, and display messages like this:

```xml
Source documents are not mapped: <EXTENSION_TABLE>
```

See the [Troubleshooting]({{ page.baseurl }}/migration/migration-troubleshooting.html) section of this guide for more information and recommendations.

<!--

When you migrate data, the Data Migration Tool verifies that tables and fields are consistent between Magento 1 and Magento 2. If they are inconsistent, you will see an error message that lists the problematic tables and fields, for example:

    Source fields are not mapped. Document: <document_name>. Fields: <field_name>

**Possible reason for error:** some database entities belong to Magento 1 extensions that do not exist in the Magento 2 database.

Below are the possible ways to handle these errors.

### Fix errors: Install corresponding Magento 2 extensions

Visit [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/){:target:"_blank"} to find the latest [extension](https://glossary.magento.com/extension) versions or contact your extension provider.

### Fix errors: Ignore entities

You may tell the Data Migration Tool to ignore the problematic entities.

To do that, add the `<ignore>` tag to an entity in the `map.xml` file, like this:

```xml
<ignore>
    <field>sales_order_address_id</field>
</ignore>
```

{: .bs-callout .bs-callout-warning }
Before ignoring entities, make sure you don't need the affected data in your Magento 2 store.

### Verify fixes

To know if the issues have been resolved successfully, run the Data Migration Tool again.
