## Clean the Magento cache

Clean the Magento cache:

```

## Manually clear directories

After the upgrade completes, manually clear `var` subdirectories:

```bash
rm -rf <Magento install dir>/var/cache/*
```

```bash
rm -rf <Magento install dir>/var/page_cache/*
```

```bash
rm -rf <Magento install dir>/generated/code/*
```

## Restart Varnish

After the upgrade completes, restart Varnish if you use it for page caching.

service varnish restart
```

Then access your [storefront](https://glossary.magento.com/storefront) and verify everything is working properly.
