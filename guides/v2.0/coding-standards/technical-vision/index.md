The Magento technical vision is a collection of documents that describe the desired state of Magento product.

Each individual technical vision document relates to a set of modules logically grouped together. Individual documents typically describe a component's place in the system, its architecture, extension scenarios. and a list of invariants that must be preserved at all times during component refactoring or extension to ensure consistency.
