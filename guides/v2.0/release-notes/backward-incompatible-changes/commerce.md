---

This topic provides details about backward incompatible changes made in {{site.data.var.ee}} 2.0.

All changes are generated automatically using the codebase of corresponding releases in private repository that contains additional modules only.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" markdown="1">
To track all changes in {{site.data.var.ee}}, consider [changes in {{site.data.var.ce}}].
</div>

The changes are aggregated into two tables:

1. **Changes in classes** that contains backward incompatible changes made to the Magento classes
2. **Changes in interfaces** that contains backward incompatible changes made to the Magento interfaces

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" markdown="1">
When the [@api] and [@deprecated] doc blocks tags are added to the code base, they are recognized as _Class was added_ or _Method has been added_. 
</div>
