Backward-incompatible changes are documented in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/guides/v2.0/release-notes/changes_2.0.html" target="_blank">Magento 2.0 Backward Incompatible Changes</a>.

### Fixed issues

####  Upgrade and Installation

<!-- 50224 -->* Magento no longer creates store data inconsistently during installation. 

<!-- 47531 -->* During upgrade, the `setup:config:set` script no longer deletes values in the `env.php` file. 

#### Import

<!-- 50255 -->* Magento now successfully imports existing products as well as products that use custom URLs. 

#### APIs

<!-- 46720 --> * The Orders {% glossarytooltip 786086f2-622b-4007-97fe-2c19e5283035 %}API{% endglossarytooltip %} now exposes the shipping address. This corrects an issue with using this API to integrate with third-party systems. 


<!-- 49558 --> * The SOAP API now returns attributes of type "text swatch" and "visual swatch" when you use the API to add attribute options. Previously, this feature did not work for these attribute types.  

#### PHP

<!-- 50500 -->* Magento now allows you to use arguments of `url` type in nested arrays. Previously, you could pass route parameters only if the `url` argument was declared at the top level.  

#### Miscellaneous

<!-- 47704 -->* Magento no longer displays {% glossarytooltip a2aff425-07dd-4bd6-9671-29b7edefa871 %}HTML{% endglossarytooltip %} tags in messages. 


<!-- 48781 --> * Product performance has been enhanced when loading {% glossarytooltip 8d40d668-4996-4856-9f81-b1386cf4b14f %}catalog{% endglossarytooltip %} products with multiple color swatches. 

<!-- 47844 -->* Magento now successfully saves and displays new customer attributes. 

<!-- 47685 --> * The Google Tag Manager {% glossarytooltip c1e4242b-1f1a-44c3-9d72-1d5b1435e142 %}module{% endglossarytooltip %} now sends impressions to the Magento Data layer.

<!-- 48124 --> * {% glossarytooltip 29ddb393-ca22-4df9-a8d4-0024d75739b1 %}Admin{% endglossarytooltip %} users can now view orders only from stores for which they have view  permission.

<!-- 49449--> * Magento performance has been improved by the removal of redundant get requests that previously occurred during {% glossarytooltip c7ecb18d-cefe-452d-83e2-3c4d5e355db9 %}shopping cart{% endglossarytooltip %} refresh.

#### Security enhancements

This release includes several enhancements to improve the security of your Magento 2.0 installation. While there are no confirmed attacks related to these issues to date, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. We recommend that you upgrade your existing Magento 2.0 installation to the latest version as soon as possible.

The following list provides an overview of the security issues fixed in this release. We describe each issue in greater detail in the <a href="https://magento.com/security" target="_blank">Magento Security Center</a>. 

<!-- 45887 -->* Issue with persistent cross-site scripting through a user account has been resolved. 

<!-- 50608 -->*  Magento now supports setting limits on password attempts. Previously, Admin and Customer Token API access did not limit the number of attempts to enter a password, inadvertently allowing brute force attempts to guess passwords. 

<!-- 50611 -->* APIs that previously granted access to anonymous users are now configured to require a higher permission level.  Default product behavior does not permit anonymous access to Catalog, Store and {% glossarytooltip f3944faf-127e-4097-9918-a2e9c647d44f %}CMS{% endglossarytooltip %} APIs. However, if you would like to allow anonymous access, you can change this setting. 


<!-- 48819 -->* Magento now prevents the arbitrary execution of {% glossarytooltip bf703ab1-ca4b-48f9-b2b7-16a81fd46e02 %}PHP{% endglossarytooltip %} code through the {% glossarytooltip 9c4c7b9b-43f0-4454-8e8c-fb62ad40c35f %}language package{% endglossarytooltip %} {% glossarytooltip 6341499b-ead9-4836-9794-53d95eb48ea5 %}CSV{% endglossarytooltip %} file. 

<!-- 47050 -->* The encryption keys that are generated in **System > Manage Encryption Key** have been strengthened. 

<!-- 50755 -->* Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) can no longer occur through the Authorizenet module’s {% glossarytooltip 510de766-1ebd-4546-bf38-c618c9c945d2 %}redirect{% endglossarytooltip %} data.
