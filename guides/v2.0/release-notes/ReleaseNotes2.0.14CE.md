<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" markdown="1">
 While there are no confirmed attacks related to these vulnerabilities to date, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. We recommend that you upgrade your existing Magento software to the latest version as soon as possible.

## Highlights

Magento 2.0.14 contains over 15 security enhancements as well as one significant functional enhancement. Look for the following highlights in this release:

<!--- 68868 -->* **Support for MasterCard BIN number expansion**. MasterCard recently added a new series of Bank Identification Numbers (BIN), and this release of Magento provides support for transactions made with cards using these new BINs. MasterCard describes the issue [here](https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/issuers/get-support/2-series-bin-expansion.html){:target="_blank"}.

* **Resolution of multiple high priority and critical security issues**. These critical issues include remote code execution for authenticated admin users, access control bypass, and CSRF issues. See [Magento 2.0.14 and 2.1.7 Security Patches](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-2014-and-217-security-update){:target="_blank"} for a comprehensive discussion of these issues.
