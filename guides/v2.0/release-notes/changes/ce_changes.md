This topic provides details about backward incompatible changes made in a [Magento CE mainline][] after the [Magento 2.0.0][] release. The content is auto-generated.

All changes are aggregated into two tables:

- [Class][] that contains backward incompatible changes made to Magento classes
- [Interface][] that contains backward incompatible changes made to the Magento interfaces

where each change is displayed in a separate row in the table, with the following columns:

- **Target** with the name of an affected class or interface
- **What changed** with the description of a backward incompatible change
