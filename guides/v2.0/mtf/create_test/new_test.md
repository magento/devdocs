title: Create a test in the Functional Testing Framework
version: 2.0
---

The FTF helps to create a new test, you can extend an out-of-the-box test, or create a completely new test.

### Extend an out-of-the-box test {#extending-oob-test}

You can extend a test by adding or replacing a [test entity][]. Test entities for the module are stored in the `<magento2_root_dir>/dev/tests/functional/tests/app/Magento/<testing_module>` directory.

#### Usage {#ext-usage}

This approach is useful when the Magento functionality was extended. For example, the minor changes were made in the existing functionality of a {% glossarytooltip c1e4242b-1f1a-44c3-9d72-1d5b1435e142 %}module{% endglossarytooltip %}. Also you can extend an out-of-the-box test to extend the current test coverage if the target functionality is not completely covered by the out-of-the-box test.

Example use cases:

- [variation addition][]
- [variation extension][]
- [fixture extension][]
- [repository addition][]
- [block overriding][]

### Create a functional test {#create-test}

If new modules are added to Magento you would need to create a new test to check the functionality.

New test must be stored in the corresponding module `<magento2_root_dir>/dev/tests/functional/tests/app/Magento/<testing_module>`.

Each test consists of four main components: a test object, test data, a test flow, a test assertion.

#### Test object {#test-object}

A test object is an object that you are going to test. Most of the test actions are performed under this object.
The test object is represented by a [fixture][].  The fixture defines properties of an object.

#### Test data {#test-data}

There are two types of test data:

 - Data for the test, stored in a [data set][].
 - Preconditions:
    - Sample data that is stored in a [fixture repository][]. In a data set, it is stored as a name of the fixture repository. 
    - A sample test entity that can be created by a [handler][].

#### Test flow {#test-flow}

A test flow is a set of test steps that you want to perform under the test object to check required functionality. Test steps are defined in a [test case][]. Usually, a test step contains a set of actions. Each action is managed by a method defined in a [block][]. A [page][] is a container for blocks. It stores selectors to identify blocks on an {% glossarytooltip a2aff425-07dd-4bd6-9671-29b7edefa871 %}HTML{% endglossarytooltip %} page. 

#### Test assertions {#test-assertions}

A test assertion compares the test flow results with the expected ones. Test assertions are represented by [constraints][].
