This guide provides instructions on installing and configuring the Functional Testing Framework (FTF). Using the FTF, you can create and run *functional* tests to make it easier to perform basic acceptance testing, smoke testing, regression testing, and so on.

FTF is an open source cross-platform solution (that is, does not depend on a specific operating system).

FTF enables you to quickly develop functional tests for the Magento application. These tests can be performed at any time.

You can run a single test independently, many tests together (that is, a test suite), or you can run all available tests.

FTF does not contain tests. All functional tests are located in `<magento2 root dir>/dev/tests/functional/`. 

### What tools should I use to run tests with FTF?   {#mtf_intro_extratools}

-   [PHPUnit][] (downloaded via {% glossarytooltip d85e2d0a-221f-4d03-aa43-0cda9f50809e %}composer{% endglossarytooltip %} during installation)

-   [Selenium Standalone Server][]

-   Web browser

### What do I have as output after running tests with FTF?   {#mtf_intro_mtf-output}

-   Tested application

-   Basic PHPUnit results

-   Screenshots of failures

-   Logs of failures

## Audience   {#mtf_intro_audi}

This guide is intended to be used by any Magento developer. In addition, it can be used by software engineers such as QA specialists, {% glossarytooltip bf703ab1-ca4b-48f9-b2b7-16a81fd46e02 %}PHP{% endglossarytooltip %} developers, and system integrators.

## Goal   {#mtf_intro_goal}

Facilitate functional testing and minimize efforts to perform
regression testing.

## Scope   {#mtf_intro_scope}

FTF is purposed to test user interactions with web application under
test.

FTF works with functional tests located in
`<magento2_root_dir>/dev/tests/functional/`.

Out-of-the-box tests cover basic functionality. Extended functionality
can be tested using customized tests, created with FTF.

Relative to your software development lifecycle, the FTF can help you:

1.    During the development phase, test any changes of functionality (new modules, update modules, fix bugs).

1.    During the maintenance phase, for periodic automated regression testing.

### FTF use cases examples   {#mtf_intro_scope_use-case-ex}

1.    As Magento developer I want to cover implemented functionality with new tests (for example, added attribute on Customer Form, extended Search functionality, added tags for Products etc).

1.    As a software engineer I want to perform regression testing before release to be confident that Magento works as expected with new functionality.

### Non-functional testing   {#mtf_intro_scope_non-func-test}

FTF works with tests from `<magento2_root_dir>/dev/tests/functional` only.
