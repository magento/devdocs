Magento 2 is flexible and as a result has varied functionality, so developing a module in Magento may take into account a number of different of the following topics. Please read the information on compatibility &#8212; [Service Contracts](service-contracts/service-contracts.html), [Design Patterns](service-contracts/design-patterns.html), and the information on [Dependency Injection](depend-inj.html), [Routing](routing.html), and [Working With Public Interfaces and APIs](api-concepts.html) closely; they are essential to creating a good Magento 2 module.



* Compatibility (Backwards and Forwards)
   * [Service Contracts](service-contracts/service-contracts.html)
   * [Design Patterns](service-contracts/design-patterns.html)

* [Object Manager / Dependency Injection](depend-inj.html)
* [EAV Attributes](attributes.html)
* [Plug-ins (aka interceptors)](plugins.html)
* [Routing](routing.html)
* [Indexing](indexing.html)
* [Configure a Service As a Web API](service-contracts/service-to-web-service.html#configure-webapi)

The following topics will be added in upcoming sprints:

* Create A New Service Contract For Your Module
* Models, Resource Models, Collections / Databases
* Security Best Practices
* System Configuration
* Scoping Configuration
* Global vs Stores vs Websites vs. Storeview

* Abstract Objects / Base Classes
