[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a dependency manager for PHP. Magento 2 uses Composer to package components and product editions. 

Some third-party components that the Magento system uses might not be present in the code base. Instead, they are listed as dependencies in the root `composer.json` file. 

## Overview of composer.json files {#composerjson-overview}
Certain Magento components and product editions are represented with `composer.json` files.

<h3>Naming conventions</h3>
The namespace of Composer packages is global within a package repository (such as [packagist.org](http://packagist.org)). The Composer specification requires that a package name use the format: 

{% highlight XML %}
<vendor_name>/<package_name>

{% endhighlight %}

As a result, vendors of different packages are distinguished, and there is a low risk of overlapping (unless different vendors names themselves exactly the same). All letters in the name must be lowercase. Therefore, the format for package names released by Magento Inc is:

{% highlight XML %}
magento/*

{% endhighlight %}

The package name is up to the vendor (as long as it is lowercase). If this name is meant to consist of multiple words, the Composer specification recommends separating them with dash. The convention for Magento package names is this:

{% highlight XML %}
magento/<type-prefix>-<suffix>[-<suffix>]...

{% endhighlight %}

Where:

`type-prefix` is a type of component in a Magento-specific domain.

`suffix` is anything that allows distinguishing/disambiguating the component within that type.

<h3>Magento-specific package types</h3>
Each Magento component can be categorized into one of the types listed in the preceding table. If any component does not fit into a specific category, it can be generalized to `magento2-component`.

Having an identifier type for each component allows the system to marshal the directories and files of each component to the correct locations, based on the Magento 2 directory structure. 

## Versioning {#component-version}
{% include php-dev/component-versioning.md %}

## Composer binary location {#composer-binary}
Magento's `bin/magento` script uses composer from the `vendor/composer` directory in your Magento 2 installation, not your globally installed Composer. Keep this in mind while customizing or updating composer or troubleshooting Composer issues while working with Magento 2.
