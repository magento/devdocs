<h2 id="config-mode-over">Overview of setting Magento modes</h2>
To improve security and ease-of-use, we added a command that switches <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}config-guide/bootstrap/magento-modes.html">Magento modes</a> from developer to production and vice versa. When doing so, we set file permissions and ownership appropriately.

Production mode also has better performance because static view files are populated in the `pub/static` directory and because of code compilation.

Developer mode uses a less restrictive set of permissions than does production mode for the following reasons:

*	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}config-guide/bootstrap/magento-modes.html#mode-developer">Developer mode</a> is intended for internal development on a system already secured behind a firewall; also, the system doesn't need to handle internet traffic
*	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}config-guide/bootstrap/magento-modes.html#mode-production">Production mode</a> servers handle internet traffic, process payments, and so on

	As the name implies, you change to production mode before you deploy your Magento storefront to production and start taking orders.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
<span class="glyphicon-class">
  <p>Unlike other Magento modes, developer and production modes are set in <code>env.php</code>.</p></span>
</div>

<h3 id="config-mode-over-clear">Cleared directories</h3>
When you change to developer or production mode, we clear the contents of following directories when you change modes:

	var/cache
	var/di
	var/generation
	var/view_preprocessed
	pub/static

Exceptions:

*	`.htaccess` files are not removed
*	`pub/static` contains a file that specifies the version of static content; this file is not removed

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
<span class="glyphicon-class">
  <p>By default, Magento uses the <code>var</code> directories to store the cache, logs, and compiled code. You can customize this directory but in this guide, it's assumed to be <code>var</code>.</p></span>
</div>

<h3 id="config-mode-dev-dirs">Permissions and ownership for developer mode</h3>
When you change to developer mode, we clear directories only; we don't set specific permissions on existing files.

However, we set the following permissions on these directories and subdirectories:

*	Directories: 770

	770 permissions give full control to the owner and to the group, and no permissions to anyone else.
*	Files: 660

	660 permissions give read-write permissions to the owner and to the group, and no permissions to anyone else.
	
<h3 id="config-mode-over-dirs">Permissions and ownership for production mode</h3>
Changing modes affects permissions and ownership the following subdirectories in your Magento installation:

	var/view_preprocessed
	var/generation
	var/di

<h4 id="config-mode-over-dirs-perm">Permissions for production mode</h4>
When you change to production mode, we set the following permissions on these directories and subdirectories:

*	Directories: 750

	750 permissions give full control to the owner, read and execute permissions to the group, and no permissions to anyone else.
*	Files: 640

	640 permissions give read-write permissions to the owner, read-only permissions to the group, and no permissions to anyone else.

<!-- 660 permissions give read-write permissions to the owner and group and no permissions to anyone else.

<!-- 640 permissions give read-write permissions to the owner, read-only to the group, and no permissions to anybody else.

770 permissions give full control (read, write, execute) to the owner and group and no permissions to anyone else. -->

<h4 id="config-mode-over-dirs-own">Ownership for production mode</h4>
We recommend the following:

*	The directories and files in the Magento file system should be *owned* by a user other than the web server user but must be *writable* by the web server user. 

	We refer to this other user as the <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/prereq/apache-user.html#nstall-update-depend-user-over">Magento file system owner</a>.

	Exceptions: `var/di`, `var/generation`, and `var/view_preprocessed`

*	The directories and files under `pub/static` should have 770 permissions, which give the owner and the group full control.

The easiest way to do that is to run this command as a user in the same group as the web server user. For details, see <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/prereq/apache-user.html">Create the Magento file system owner</a>.

<h2 id="config-mode-show">Display the current mode</h2>
Command usage:

	magento deploy:mode:show

A message similar to the following displays:

	Current application mode: developer.

<h2 id="config-mode">Change modes</h2>
Command usage:

	magento deploy:mode:set {mode} [-s|--skip-compilation]

where 

`{mode}` is required; it can be `default`, `developer` or `production`

`--skip-compilation` is an optional parameter you can use to skip <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-compiler-single.html#config-cli-subcommands-single-overview">code compilation</a> when you change to production mode.


Examples follow.

### Change to production mode

	magento deploy:mode:set production

### Change to developer mode
When you change from production to developer mode, you should clear generated classes and Object Manager entities like proxies to prevent unexpected errors. After doing so, you can change modes. Use the following steps:

1.	If you're changing from production mode to developer mode, delete the contents of the `var/generation` and `var/di` directories:

		rm -rf <your Magento install dir>/var/di/* <your Magento install dir>/var/generation/* 

2.	Set the mode:

		magento deploy:mode:set developer

	The following message displays:

		Switched to developer mode.
