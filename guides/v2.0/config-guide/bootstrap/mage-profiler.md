Magento profiling enables you to:

-   Enable a built-in profiler.

	You can use a built-in profiler with Magento to perform tasks such as analyzing performance. (The nature of profiling depends on the analytical tools you use. We support multiple formats, including HTML.)

-   Displays dependency graphs on a Magento page. A *dependency graph* is a list of object dependencies and all of their all their dependencies, and all the dependencies for those dependencies, and so on.

	You should be particularly interested in the list of *unused dependencies*, which are objects that were created because they were requested in some constructor, but were never used (that is, none of their methods were called). As a result, processor time and memory spent to create these dependencies are wasted.

Magento provides the base functionality in <a href="{{ site.mage2000url }}lib/internal/Magento/Framework/Profiler.php" target="\_blank">Magento\Framework\Profiler</a>.

## Set MAGE_PROFILER
`MAGE_PROFILER` supports the following values:

-   `1` to enable a specific profiler's output.

	You can also use one of the following values to enable a specific profiler:

    - `csvfile` which uses <a href="{{ site.mage2000url }}lib/internal/Magento/Framework/Profiler/Driver/Standard/Output/Csvfile.php" target="\_blank">Magento\Framework\Profiler\Driver\Standard\Output\Csvfile</a>
    - Any other value (except `2`), including an empty value, which uses <a href="{{ site.mage2000url }}lib/internal/Magento/Framework/Profiler/Driver/Standard/Output/Html.php" target="\_blank">Magento\Framework\Profiler\Driver\Standard\Output\Html</a>

-   `2` to enable dependency graphs.

	Dependency graphs typically display at the bottom of a page. The following figure shows portion of the output:

You can set the value of `MAGE_PROFILER` in any of the ways discussed in <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/bootstrap/magento-how-to-set.html">Set the value of bootstrap parameters</a>.
