<h2 id="m2arch-translations-overview">Overview</h2>

Any text that's presented to the user can have a variety of captions or labels on the control elements, notifications, and error messages. The Magento application renders all these phrases in English (`US`) language (`en_US`). But if you deploy a storefront in a different language (or use the Magento Admin in different language), you can use other dictionaries for translations.

You can either use translation packages provided with the Magento application, create your own, or obtain packages from the community.
