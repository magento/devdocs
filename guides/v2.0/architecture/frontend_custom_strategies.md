<h2 id="m2arch-whatis-overview">Ease of frontend customization</h2>


The Magento frontend is designed to optimize storefront customization. Merchants are encouraged to use Magento components to customize the look-and-feel of their storefronts. 

Highly extensible <i>themes</i> are the central mechanism for Magento front-end customization. Merchants are encouraged to extend and transform the appearance of their storefronts using themes.

Magento provides several tools to help you significantly jumpstart the storefront customization process: 

* Magento Blank Theme

* <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}ui-components/ui-component.html">Magento UI Library Components</a>

* <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}pattern-library/bk-pattern.html">Magento Admin Pattern Library</a>



See <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}frontend-dev-guide/bk-frontend-dev-guide.html">Frontend Developer Guide</a> for information on creating your own themes.  

 

<h3>Magento Blank theme</h3>
The Magento blank theme template provides a launchpad for storefront customization. You can use this boilerplate as a robust starting point for your own theme development. 


<h3>Magento UI components</h3>
Using Magento standard coding and styling tools can help: 

* enforce for consistency in design across your storefronts 
* simplify (and speed up) the design process

This component library contains standard reusable components for form features, such as fields and buttons, and navigation elements. The Magento UI library is a set of generic web components and Magento-specific patterns, which simplifies the process of Magento theme creation and customization.

See <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}ui-components/ui-component.html">Magento UI Library Components</a> for details about this library. 

<h3>Magento Admin pattern library</h3>

A <i>pattern library</i> is a collection of user interface (UI) design patterns that can be re-used in locations throughout your product installation. The <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}pattern-library/bk-pattern.html">Magento Admin Pattern Library</a> defines examples of components that administrators working with the storefront can use. 

Form elements included in the Magento Admin pattern library include:

* address form 
* button bar
* container
* tabs
* sign in form

Users of the default Magento storefront encounter examples of these form elements throughout the product. These patterns provide a valuable language of software components (and indirectly, user experiences) for extension developers and administrators.  


The Magento Admin Pattern library is built on the LESS preprocessor and implemented as a module. You can download a free, current version of this module from Magento Marketplace. 


See <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}pattern-library/bk-pattern.html">Magento Admin Pattern Library</a> for more information on using this library.
