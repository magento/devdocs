## Migrate themes from Magento 1 to Magento 2

Magento 1 themes cannot be migrated to Magento 2 directly but we provide the following options:

* Working with your frontend developer or designer to create a new theme for Magento 2. Use this chance to make sure your site is responsive and to follow best practices.

	For assistance, see the [Frontend Developer Guide]({{ site.gdeurl }}frontend-dev-guide/bk-frontend-dev-guide.html)
* Installing one of the available themes from the <a href="https://marketplace.magento.com/themes.html" target="_blank">Magento Marketplace</a>.
