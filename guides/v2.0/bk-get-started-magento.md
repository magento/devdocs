<h2 id="highlights">Getting started with Magento</h2>

Welcome to Magento 2.0 documentation! And welcome to Magento 2.0!

Here we explain the Magento platform and components from the perspective of several audiences: merchants, web store developers (frontend developers), extension developers, system administrators, installers, and integrators.

Magento is a highly-customizable eCommerce platform and content management system that is primarily used to build online storefronts or web sites for selling merchandise.

Magento is written using the PHP programming language, and leverages elements of the Zend framework and the model-view-controller architecture. Magento runs on the MySQL relational database, and Magento schema and tables are included in the Magento installation package.
