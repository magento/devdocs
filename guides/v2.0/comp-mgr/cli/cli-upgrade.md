## Prerequisite: `pub` directory root {#upgrade-cli-pub}
This section applies to you *only* if you set the Magento root directory to `<your Magento install dir>/pub`. If you did not do this, skip this section and continue with the next section.

If you use `pub` as your Magento root directory, you can do any of the following:

*	For the upgrade, create another subdomain or docroot that uses the Magento installation directory as its root. 

	Run the [System Upgrade utility]({{ site.gdeurl }}comp-mgr/upgrader/upgrade-start.html) using that subdomain.
*	Use the [following procedure](#upgrade-cli-upgr) to upgrade Magento using the command line.

## Upgrade using the command line {#upgrade-cli-upgr}
To upgrade using the command line:

1.	Log in to your Magento server as, or switch to, the Magento file system owner.
2.	Change to the directory in which you installed the Magento software.

	For example, `cd /var/www/html/magento2`
2.	Enter the following commands in the order shown:

		composer require <product> <version> --no-update
		composer update

	For example, to upgrade to Magento CE version 2.0.5, enter:
