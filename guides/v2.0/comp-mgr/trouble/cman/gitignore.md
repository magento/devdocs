### Problem: missing `.gitignore` files {#missing-ignore}

If you downloaded a compressed archive, there might have been missing `.gitignore` files that prevent the upgrade from completing properly. To apply our update, patch `magento/magento-composer-installer` then run `composer update` from your Magento installation directory. 

The following figure shows an example of this issue when using the Setup Wizard.
