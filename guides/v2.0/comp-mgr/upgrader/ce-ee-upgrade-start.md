## Start System Upgrade from the Magento Admin   {#compman-access}

To run System Upgrade:

1.	Log in to the {% glossarytooltip 18b930cf-09cc-47c9-a5e5-905f86c43f81 %}Magento Admin{% endglossarytooltip %} as an administrator.
2.	Click **System** > **Web Setup Wizard**.

	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cman_upgr_initial.png" width="650px" alt="Specify whether to manage components or upgrade Magento">
3.	Click **System Upgrade**.

	Magento begins searching for core module updates immediately. To also search for component updates, click **Yes**. A sample follows:

	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/upgr_initial-pg.png" width="650px" alt="Magento begins searching for upgrades right away">
