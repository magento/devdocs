<h2 id="compman-overview">Overview of Magento Community Edition (CE) to Magento Enterprise Edition (EE) upgrade</h2>
This section discusses how to upgrade Magento CE to Magento EE.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
	<p>You must be authorized for Magento EE to perform the tasks discussed in this topic.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="compman-prereq">Prerequisites</h2>
Before continuing, complete all tasks discussed in <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}comp-mgr/prereq/prereq_compman.html">Prerequisites</a>.

In addition, you might need to install the PHP <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php" target="_blank">`bcmath`</a> extension, which is required by EE. Examples follow:

*	CentOS (using the `webtatic` repository): `yum -y install php56w-bcmath`
*	Ubuntu (using the `ppa:ondrej/php5-5.6` repository): `apt-get -y install php5-bcmath`

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
	<p>Make sure you are authorized for Magento EE access before you continue. Contact <a href="http://support.magentocommerce.com" target="_blank">Magento Support</a> if you have questions.</p>
