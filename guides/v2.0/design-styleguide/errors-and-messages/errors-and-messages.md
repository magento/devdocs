Magento uses different types of dynamic messaging to alert users when:

* An error has occurred and blocks them in completing a task

* Users need to know important information before continuing a task

## Types of Errors and Messages

* **Information information.** This messaging is not an error. It's used when a person can continue with the task but needs to be alerted regarding information critical to completing a task.

* **Recoverable error.** Used when a person is blocked and can only continue by taking an action to fix the problem.

* **Not recoverable / catastrophic error.** Used when a person can’t complete the task currently. Usually, it’s due to system error, the server is down, etc. For ideal next steps for users, include a contact method to fix the issue. If a contact method isn't available, provide guidance for the user to try again at a later time.

## How to Write Errors Content

Use complete sentences and brief, exact, but conversational language.

1. Avoid the following words – personal pronouns, "please", and "sorry".

2. Specify what went wrong.

3. Tell users how to fix the problem and continue the current task. If the problem can’t be resolved online, give users appropriate options to contact us or try again at a later time.

### Tone and Language

Don’t blame the user or indicate that the user made a mistake.

*Example:*

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li><strong>No</strong> – “You didn’t enter your email address. Enter your email address and click “Continue”."</li>
  <li>Yes – “An email address is required. Enter your email address and click “Continue”.”</li>
</ul>  
<br>
