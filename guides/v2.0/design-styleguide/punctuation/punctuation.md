The following sections surface exceptions to the Associated Press (AP) Stylebook and summarize key stylebook elements to keep handy when writing content.

## Sentences

All grammatically correct sentences end in punctuation, usually a period. When introducing a series or a list, end sentences with a colon.

## Punctuation to Avoid

* (;) **Semicolons.** Often, these awkwardly break sentences, and many users will find difficulty in understanding. Usually, a writer can simplify the sentence rather than use semicolons. Do not use in place of a conjunction.

* **Never use these punctuation types,** unless they are included as part of a brand name:

  - (&) **Ampersands** – international users don't understand what ampersands mean

  - (!) **Exclamation points**

## Rules For ...

### Commas

<ul>
  <li><strong>Conjunctions.</strong> Use a comma before a conjunction to separate independent clauses (note: clauses have a subject and predicate) joined by conjunctions, including and, but, for, or, nor, so, and yet. <em>See example:</em>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li><strong>No</strong> – “Users go to the Cart and review their items. (No comma's needed, since no subject follows “and”.)"</li>
      <li>Yes – “Users go to the Cart, and they review their items.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Use Oxford comma.</strong> Different from AP. We always use the Oxford or "serial" comma, which is the final comma in a list of items. <em>Correct example:</em> “Retain customers with custom registries, gift cards, and store credit.”</li>
  <li><strong>Parenthesis.</strong> For details, jump to the <span markdown="1">[Parenthesis]({{ page.baseurl }}/design-styleguide/punctuation/punctuation.html#parenthesis)</span> section.</li>
  <li><strong>Numbers, dates, addresses.</strong> For details, see <span markdown="1">[Number Formats]({{ page.baseurl }}/design-styleguide/number-formats/number-formats.html).</span></li>
  <li><strong>Introductory phrases.</strong> Use commas to set off introductory phrases. ... Commas can be omitted after short phrases as long as the meaning, transitioning between phrase and sentence, is clear. <em>Correct example:</em> "(After <em>-or-</em> Following <em>-or-</em> To follow) this section, read the Associated Press (AP) Stylebook’s commas entry."</li>
  <li><strong>Non-essential phrases.</strong> A non-essential phrase is a phrase that can be removed from a sentence without adversely affecting its meaning. "Which" is used for non-essential phrases, and "that" is used for essential phrases. <em>See correct examples:</em>
  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
    <li>Non-essential – "Promotions, which are set up with cart and catalog rules, are created in the Admin panel."</li>
    <li>Essential – "Promotions that are set up with catalog rules do not display in Cart."</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

### Colon

Use to end a sentence before:

<ul>
  <li>A complex series of items. Don't use a colon with a simple series. Also, consider using a list for a complex series of items. For details, see <span markdown="1">[Lists]({{ page.baseurl }}/design-styleguide/content-formats/content-formats.html#lists)</span> section in Content Formats. <em>See examples:</em>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li><strong>No</strong> – “A shopping cart may include: pants, hats, and scarves."</li>
      <li>Yes – “A shopping cart may include pants, hats, and scarves.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A bulleted list</li>
  <li>A long quotation</li>
  <li>An introductory, independent clause ... *Correct example:* "Here's an idea: Add a clause to a sentence."</li>
</ul>

Use between a title and a description or subtitle ... *Correct example:* "Magento Live: Take Your Business to the Next Level"

**Capitalization after a colon.** When a complete sentence follows a colon, capitalize the first word of the following sentence. When a series or partial sentence follows a colon, do not capitalize.

*Correct examples:*

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li>Complete sentence – "The company makes the following promise: This solution will improve your bottom line.”</li>
  <li>Series – “There are three considerations: expense, time, and feasibility.”</li>
</ul>

### Ellipsis

(...) Use with one space before and one space after. ... Example: "The user will ... complete a sentence."

Use in:

* Headers or sentences to introduce a bulleted list, when the preceding text and items complete a sentence.

* Data labels to introduce a data field that completes a sentence.

* Field labels to introduce a variable entry field that can be customized.

### Em Dashes

(—) Use an em dash with a space on either side, as a longer breather between ideas. Do not use for ranges of numbers.

*Correct example:* The em dash — as noted in the stylebook — should have spaces before and after its placement.

### Hyphens

(-) Use for:

* Compound modifiers, but not common prefixes. ... *Correct examples:* high-value item, hard-to-find item

* Multiple modifiers. ... *Correct example:* "high- and low-value items"

* Exceptions include:

  - Adverbs ... *Incorrect example:* "highly-valued item"

  - When not paired with a noun ... *Incorrect example:* "The item is high-value."

* Do not use as a dash. See em dashes in previous entry.

### Footnotes

(reference<sup>1</sup>) Should use a number – not an asterisk or other symbols – here<sup>1</sup> and here<sup>2</sup>, and the legal content that it references should be placed in the footer.

### Money

For details, see the [Money]({{ page.baseurl }}/design-styleguide/number-formats/number-formats.html#money) section in Number Formats.

### Percentages

(%) Spell out "percent" unless space is constrained, as in a form or a data table. ... *Correct example:* 23 percent

### Parenthesis

Avoid using. Instead, use commas to set off parenthetical expressions or content.

*Example:*

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li><strong>No</strong> – Magento publishes User Guides (used primarily by Merchants).</li>
  <li>Yes – Magento publishes User Guides, used primarily by Merchants.</li>
</ul>

For acronyms that aren't referenced on first use, append them at the end of the term. ... *Correct example:* World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)

### Question Marks

(?) Generally avoid questions in content – use declarations.

### Quotation Marks

(") Always use double quotation marks when someone is speaking. Avoid "that" before quotes.

*Example:*

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li><strong>No</strong> – Mark Lavelle said that “the winners of the 2015 Imagine Excellence Awards embody the relentless commitment of our clients.”</li>
  <li>Yes – “The winners of the 2016 Imagine Excellence Awards embody the relentless commitment of our clients and partners,” said Mark Lavelle.</li>
</ul>  

### Slashes

( / ) Use only when space is constrained – in a form or a data table. Otherwise, spell out "and" or "or", instead.
