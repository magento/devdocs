Buttons are primarily used for task-based navigation, and links are primarily used for site navigation.

However, both buttons and links can function as calls to action (CTAs). Whether button or link, a CTA is used to encourage a user to take an action. CTA labels use title case and active verbs, should be short, and should use labels consistently across the Admin panel.

For more details, see [Title Case standards]({{ page.baseurl }}/design-styleguide/capitalization/capitalization.html#title-case) in Capitalization.

*Examples:*

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li><strong>No</strong> – “Free Demo”</li>
  <li>Yes – “Sign Up for Free Demo”</li>
</ul>  


<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li><strong>No</strong> – “New Rule”</li>
  <li>Yes – “Add Rule”</li>
</ul>  

## Buttons

Buttons are calls to action, and their labels should be limited to three words (four words maximum, if including a short verb or word).

Buttons can be used for:

* Calls to action for task flows: to begin, continue, or submit a task

* Navigation in featured modules of content, like banners and content teasers

Button types are primary, secondary, and tertiary. Each page should have a maximum limit of one primary button. Split buttons include multiple actions. Button counts in a Button Bar or any array of buttons should be limited to four buttons, maximum.

**For design specs,** see [Buttons]({{ page.baseurl }}/pattern-library/controls/buttons/buttons.html) and [Button Bar]({{ page.baseurl }}/pattern-library/controls/button-bar/button-bar.html) patterns.

## Links

Minimize the amount of words — within 2-5 words, ideally — in a link label and use best practices in finding optimal keywords.

Other links guidance includes:

* **Avoid spawning new windows / tabs.** As a general rule, new tabs and windows can confuse users and cause them to close their browser windows. However, exceptions for usage do exist.

* **External-link icon.** Only use when linking to a non-Magento page. ... *Correct example:* Go to [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)

Links can be used as content links (for site navigation) and non-primary CTAs. When used as CTAs, link labels should be long enough to be understood, but as short as possible. However, a link CTA's label may sometimes stretch a few words longer than a button label.

**For link typography specs,** see [Legal and Link Text]({{ page.baseurl }}/design-styleguide/typography/typography.html#legal-and-link-text) in Typography standards.

## Accessibility

* **Never use “click here” as a label.** Labels should identify and describe the target of the link.

* **Avoid using file names or URLs as link labels.**

* **Clearly identify file download links.** Indicate in the label that the user is about to "download" a file.

* **For anchor links, use "Jump to" before the link.** This identifies the link as an anchor and that it won't navigate users to another page.

* **Use linked icons with care.** Users may not know what the icon means, so for icons that aren't globally recognized, pair a linked label with a linked icon. See [Iconography standards]({{ page.baseurl }}/design-styleguide/iconography/iconography.html).

## Labels Best Practices

<ul>
  <li><strong>Parallelism.</strong> When linking to a page with a direct reference, match the exact wording of the page title or, for anchor tags, the section heading title.</li>
  <li><strong>PDFs and other file formats.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Append the document-type acronym after the link label and link only the document title.</li>
      <li>Use all caps case and do not add a period to the acronym. See <span markdown="1">[All Caps case standards]({{ page.baseurl }}/design-styleguide/capitalization/capitalization.html#all-caps)</span> in Capitalization.</li>
      <li>Do not use the file name or URL in the content &#8212; use the title of the document.</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Example:</em>
      <ul style="list-style-type:none">
        <li><strong>No</strong> – “<a href="javascript:void(0);">Download FAQs (.PDF)</a>”</li>
        <li><strong>No</strong> – “<a href="javascript:void(0);">Download FAQs (.pdf)</a>”</li>
        <li><strong>No</strong> – “<a href="javascript:void(0);">Download faqs-bh-v1.pdf</a>”</li>
        <li>Yes – “<a href="javascript:void(0);">Download FAQs (PDF)</a>”</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

## When to Verify a Call to Action

For actions like “Delete” and “Cancel”, always consider the possibility that the user took the action by mistake.

If the user will lose a lot of work — or if the user's task is not easily recoverable — after taking the action, create an interstitial verify step that happens first when the action is selected.

### Label and Content Format

Use the following template to create content for a verify step:

* **Title:** Before you [ Task Label ]

* **Explainer content:** [ Specify the full implications for the action the user wants to take. ]

* **Verification content:** Are you sure you want to continue?

* **Calls to action:** [ Task Label ], Cancel ... *Note:* The "Task Label" is the primary call to action and matches the Title's Task Label.

## Button Labels Used in Admin

**Specify actions in buttons:** Appending a specific label to a call to action’s verb clarifies the action that the user is taking. ... *Example:* "Add Row" is more contextual and understandable than "Add".

The following labels are the standards for Admin labels. Refer to these footnotes for call-to-action hierarchy:
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li><strong>*</strong> — A primary call to action.</li>
  <li><strong>**</strong> — In specific contexts, can be used as a primary call to action.</li>
</ul>
