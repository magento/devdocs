## Welcome to Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition
Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition is a managed and automated high-availability hosting platform for
Magento.

You code, and we automatically put everything into production.

### No system administrator required
We deploy databases, web server, and caching servers with no sysadmin work.
It's fully automated and happens almost instantly. Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition cuts out the
middleman between your code and deployment.

### Details
* Every Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition plan includes eight active environments for development and staging. (Additional active environments are available at additional cost.)

	You can have as many *inactive* environments as you wish.  
* You can add fully managed services like MySQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, RabbitMQ, and so on, without requiring external add-ons.
* We use a robust Composer build process.
* You can increase the amount of memory and CPU as needed.

## Great integrations
Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition comes out-of-the-box with great integrations for services such
as Bitbucket, GitHub, HipChat, Blackfire, and generic webhooks that enable you 
to integrate with internal tooling with little effort.
