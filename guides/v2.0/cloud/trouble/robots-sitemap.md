The `pub` directory is _read only_ in the {{site.data.var.ece}} Integration, Staging, and Production environments. An attempt to generate and write the `sitemap.xml` file to the root directory results in the following error:

```
The path ".:///app/app/" is not writable.
Path "/app/pub/static/sitemap.xml" is protected and cannot be used.
```

To avoid this error, you can only write to specific directories, such as `var`, `pub/media`, or `app/etc`. When using {{site.data.var.ece}}, you must use a redirect in the _read-only_ environments.  Generate the files on your local workstation and upload them to one of the write-enabled directories using the following, appropriate environment:

-  For Starter, access the `staging` branch
-  For Pro, access the `integration` branch

#### To add a `sitemap.xml` file:

1.  On your local branch, access the Magento Admin panel.
1.  On the _Marketing_ menu, click **Site Map**.
1.  In the _Site Map_ view, click **Add Sitemap**.
1.  In the _New Site Map_ view, enter the following values:

    -  **Filename**:`sitemap.xml`
    -  **Path**:`/pub/media/`

1.  Click **Save & Generate**.
1.  Import the generated files to the `pub/media` directory on the server.
1.  Log in to the remote environment using SSH.
1.  Move the files into the `/pub/media/` directory using the rsync command:

    ```bash
    rsync -azvP pub/media/ <user_name>@<environment_IP_address>:pub/media/
    ```

1.  This results in a `www.example.com/media/sitemap.xml` path, so you must submit a Support ticket to apply a redirect for your generated files.

{% include note.html type="warning" content="Do not change the location of the files during deployment." %}

#### To add a `robots.txt` file:

1.  On your local branch, access the Magento Admin panel.
1.  On the _Content_ menu, click **Configuration**.
1.  In the _Design Configuration_ view, click **Edit** for the Global Website.
1.  In the _Main Website_ view, click **Search Engine Robots** in the _Other Settings_ section.
1.  Select options and update the `robots.txt` file.
1.  Click **Save Configuration**.

## Rewrite using Fastly VCL snippet

You can generate the `sitemap.xml` file in the Magento Admin panel as described above, but you can avoid a Support ticket by creating a custom Fastly VCL snippet to manage the redirect. See [Custom Fastly VCL snippets]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/cdn/cloud-vcl-custom-snippets.html).

#### To use a Fastly VCL snippet for redirect:

Create a custom VCL snippet to rewrite the path for `sitemap.xml` to `/media/sitemap.xml` using the `type` and `content` key and value pairs.

```json
{ 
  "name": "sitemapxml_rewrite",
  "dynamic": "0",
  "type": "recv",
  "priority": "90",
  "content": "if ( req.url.path ~ \"^/?sitemap.xml$\" ) { set req.url = \"/media/sitemap.xml\"; }" 
}
```

{% include note.html type="tip" content="When you upgrade from Magento version 2.1 to version 2.2, enter a Support ticket to remove any existing redirects for these files." %}
