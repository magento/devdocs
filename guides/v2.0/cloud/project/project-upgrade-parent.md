The following information helps you upgrade and patch {{site.data.var.ece}}. All of our upgrades and patches are [Composer]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/reference/cloud-composer.html) driven. We recommend using `composer update` for running updates.

As part of your normal pushes of code, {{site.data.var.ece}} checks for any pending patches and updates. These instructions walk through the specific steps needed, including preparing, updating, and verifying the upgrade.

What you need:

* An active branch on your local to test in your Integration environment. We recommend using a dedicated branch for the upgrades and patches, without additional in-progress extension or code work.
* Access to the environment and variables if needed
