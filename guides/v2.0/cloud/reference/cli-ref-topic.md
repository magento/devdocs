The Magento Cloud CLI is a cloud-specific version of the Magento CLI we provide supporting commands including Magento management and Git interactions. You can install and use these commands for all Starter environments and Pro Integration environments. You cannot use these commands on Pro plan Staging and Production environments.

This reference lists all available commands, and a list of commonly used commands, for {{site.data.var.ece}}. You can also use Magento CLI commands as needed, using `bin/magento` for entering commands.

You will [install]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/before/before-workspace-magento-prereqs.html) the Magento Cloud CLI on your local when setting up your local environment for development.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info" markdown="1">
You must install the Magento Cloud CLI to your local workspace to issue commands. For details, see:

* [Install Magento prerequisites]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/before/before-workspace-magento-prereqs.html)
* [Enable SSH keys]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/before/before-workspace-ssh.html)
</div>

The following Magento Cloud CLI commands can be run from any directory and run best from a project directory. When run from a project directory, you can omit the `-p <project ID>` parameter. These commands are meant to be used to manage Integration environments.

You may notice these commands are similar to Git commands. The `magento-cloud` Git commands directly connect with Magento Git, the Magento ECE project, with additional features. For example, when you push a Git branch, it is not activated until you access GitHub. The Magento CLI command includes activation.

All listed commands include only the required information and options. These commands may include additional options. To see all options and help, append `--help` with any `magento-cloud` command .

`git commit --allow-empty -m "redeploy" && git push <branch name>`
:  Push an empty commit to force a redeployment. Some actions, like adding a user for example, don't result in deployment.

`magento-cloud login`
:	Log in to the project.

`magento-cloud project:get <project ID> <directory> -e <environment ID>`
:	Clone a project to a directory. To clone the `master` environment, omit `-e <environment ID>`.

`magento-cloud environment:list -p <project ID>`
:	List the environments in the current project (that is, the project that corresponds to the directory in which you run the command).

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info" markdown="1">
`magento-cloud environment:list` displays environment hierarchies whereas `git branch` does not. If you have any nested environments, use `magento-cloud environment:list`.
</div>

`magento-cloud environment:branch <name> <parent branch>`
:	Create a new branch; the environment has both a name and an ID.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info" markdown="1">
The environment _name_ is different from the environment _ID_ only if you use spaces or capital letters in the environment name. An environment ID consists of all lowercase letters, numbers, and allowed symbols. Capital letters in an environment name are converted to lowercase in the ID; spaces in an environment name are converted to dashes.

An environment name _cannot_ include characters reserved for your Linux shell or for regular expressions. Forbidden characters include curly braces (`{ }`), parentheses, asterisk (`*`), angle brackets (`< >`), ampersand (`&`), percent (`%`), and other characters.
</div>

`magento-cloud environment:checkout <environment ID>`
:	Check out an existing environment.

`magento-cloud environment:merge -p <project ID> -e <environment ID>`
:	Merge changes in this environment with its parent.

`magento-cloud environment:synchronize -p <project ID> -e <environment ID> {code|data}`
:	Synchronize (that is, `git pull`) code and/or data from the parent to this environment.

`magento-cloud variable:list`
:	List variables in this environment.

`magento-cloud variable:set <name> <value>`
:	Set a value for an environment variable in this environment.

## Display all commands {#all}

## Upgrade Magento Cloud CLI {#upgrade}

When you login to the Magento Cloud CLI, it checks for available updates. You can enter `y` for yes to upgrade. After upgrading, you can login and use the `magento-cloud list` command to see a list of all commands.
