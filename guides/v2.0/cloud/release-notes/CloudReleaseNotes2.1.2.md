### Changes in this release

We made the following change in this release:

* Added a new environment variable, `UPDATE_URLS`, which if set to `enabled` causes Magento base URLs in the database with to be replaced with Cloud project URLs. By default, `UPDATE_URLS` is set to `enabled`. This is useful for local development, where base URLs are set up for your local environment. When you deploy to a Cloud environment, we change the URLs so you can access your storefront and Magento Admin using project URLs. You should set this variable to `disabled` *only* in staging or production, where the base URLs can't change.
* Staging and Production environments in the UI for Pro projects. You can enter a ticket to have your project updated. For more information, see [Add Staging and Production to Pro projects UI]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/trouble/pro-env-management.html).

### Functional fixes and enhancements

We made the following fixes in this release:

* Improved the performance of static file deployment.
*	You can now upgrade to version 2.1.2 if you enabled [static file signatures](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/system/static-file-signature.html){:target="\_blank"}.
*   You no longer need a `pub/front-static.php` in your template.
*   We now back up `env.php` before disabling the Redis cache during deployment.
*   Patches are now applied in alphabetical order.
* Staging and Production environments in the UI for Pro projects. Starting October 23, 2017, all projects created using the free 30-day trial or provisioned for new accounts includes Staging and Production environments in the Project Web Interface. Existing accounts created before October 23, 2017 can enter a ticket to be updated. For more information, see [Add Staging and Production to Pro projects UI]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/trouble/pro-env-management.html).

### Known issues

Note the following issue in this release:

The `magento setup:install` command (used for deployment) fails in either a staging or production environment if a Magento database already exists in the following scenario:

*   You installed or updated a component in your integration environment that modifies the database (especially if the component adds tables).
*   Your staging or production environment has an existing database.

This is a known issue with Magento core software; we're actively working to address this issue. If you encounter this issue, contact Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition Support:

1.  Log in to your Magento Cloud account.
2.  Click **Support** > **Submit ticket** from the top menu.
3.  Follow the prompts to open an issue with Support.
