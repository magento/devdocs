## Changes and enhancements in this release {#changes-and-enhancements-in-this-release}

In `magento-cloud-configuration` releases 101.7.3, 101.7.4, 101.7.5, and 101.7.6 on Magento Commerce 2.1.7, we provide the following improvements:

### 101.7.6 changes {#changes}

* Weâ€™ve added support for the latest version of Redis and for PHP-Redis 3.1.3. For more information on this update, and for guidance on Redis troubleshooting on {{site.data.var.ece}}, see [Redis troubleshooting]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/v2.0/cloud/trouble/redis-troubleshooting.html).

### 101.7.5 changes {#changes-1}

* Magento no longer automatically disables Google Analytics when deployed in the master branch.
* HTML minification now works as expected on Cloud.

### 101.7.4 changes {#changes-2}

* Magento no longer purges all Redis user sessions during deployment, but only the database where the cache is stored.

### 101.7.3 changes {#changes-3}

* Magento no longer throws an error when only the default store issued. Previously, when only the default store is used, Magento threw the following error when running php bin/magento magento-cloud:scd-dump:

    Exception]
    	Notice: Undefined index: stores in /app/vendor/magento/magento-cloud-configuration/src/Magento/MagentoCloud/Console/Command/SCDConfigDump.php on line 91
