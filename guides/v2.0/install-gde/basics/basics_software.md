The full list of software is listed in <a href="{{page.baseurl}}install-gde/system-requirements.html">System Requirements</a> but here are the essentials:

*	Web server to display web pages. Currently, we've documented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server" target="_blank">Apache</a> and plan to document other web servers in the near future.

*	Database management system for long-term data storage and retrieval. We support <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/what-is-mysql.html" target="_blank">MySQL</a>.

*	PHP, an acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, an open source scripting language suited for web development because it can be embedded in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp" target="_blank">HTML</a> (the language of the web).

	For more information, see the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php" target="_blank">PHP manual</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>.
