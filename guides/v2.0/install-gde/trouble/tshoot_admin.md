<h2 id="install-trouble-admin-login">Error after logging in to the Magento Admin</h2>

	The requested URL /magento2index.php/admin/admin/dashboard/index/key/0c81957145a968b697c32a846598dc2e/ was not found on this server.

Note the lack of a slash character between <tt>magento2</tt> and <tt>index.php</tt> in the URL.

### Solution

The base URL is not correct. The base URL must start with <tt>http://</tt> or <tt>https://</tt> *and* it must end with a slash (/). Run the installation again with a valid value.
