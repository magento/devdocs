<h2 id="install-trouble-web-browser">Cannot access Magento software in a web browser</h2>

### Symptom: The following message displays when you try to access the Magento storefront or Admin:

	Whoops, it looks like you have an invalid PHP version.
	Magento supports PHP 5.5 or newer.
	
#### Solution

Either upgrade PHP or restart Apache (Apache might not be using the same PHP version as is on the file system).

### Symptom: A 404 (Not Found) error displays.

#### Solution

Likely an issue with the base URL you entered during the installation. You specify the base URL as the value of `--base-url=` when installing Magento from the command line or as the value of the **Your Store Address** field on the Web Configuration page of the web installer.
	
The base URL *must* start with the scheme (such as `http://`) and end with a trailing slash (/). Run the installer again with a valid value and try accessing Magento afterward.

To restart Apache:

*	Ubuntu: `service apache2 restart`
*	CentOS: `service httpd restart`
