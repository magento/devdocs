## Before you continue
Did you remember to set file system ownership and permissions? If not, <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/install/file-system-perms.html">go back</a> and do that now.


## Installation options: command line or Setup Wizard
Now that you've installed prerequisites and taken the first steps (merchant, system integrator, or developer), you're ready to install the Magento software in any of the following ways:

*	Using the web-based <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/install/web/install-web.html">Setup Wizard</a>, which is better for less experienced users or anyone who has a hosting provider (especially if you don't have access to the Magento server)
*	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/install/cli/install-cli.html">Command line</a>, which gives you more control but requires more experience and also access to the Magento server

<!-- ## Already installed the Magento software?
You might want to manage Magento components or to upgrade:
