A contributing developer reinstalls Magento by updating `composer.json` to specify the Magento product version and component versions desired and runs `composer update`. 

To reinstall the Magento software as a contributing developer:

2.	Log in to your Magento server as a user with permissions to modify files in the Magento file system (for example, the <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/prereq/file-sys-perms-over.html">switch to the Magento file system owner</a>.
3.	Make a backup copy of `composer.json` in your Magento installation directory:

		cd <your Magento install dir>
		cp composer.json composer.json.bak

4.	Open `composer.json` in a text editor.
5.	Locate the following line:

		 "require": {
        	"magento/product-community-edition": "<version>"
    	},

5.	Replace `<version>` with the version to which you want to upgrade, where `<version>` is the product version to use. 
	
	(The product version is in the format `2.0.x`)
<!-- is the `magento/product-community-edition` version from -->.
5.	Save your changes to `composer.json` and exit the text editor.
6.	Enter the following command:

		composer update

	Wait for dependencies to update.
