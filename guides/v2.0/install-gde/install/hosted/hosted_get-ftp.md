## Set up FTP and transfer the Magento archive   {#set-up-ftp}

FTP is a way to transfer files from your computer to your managed server. To transfer the Magento archive, you need an FTP account that has access to the managed server's `public_html` directory. You might already have an account. If not, consult your shared hosting provider's documentation or technical support for more information.

### Transfer the Magento archive to your hosted system

To transfer the Magento archive:

1.	Start your FTP client software.
2.	Create a connection to your managed server.

	Follow the prompts on your screen or consult the documentation provided with your FTP software for more information.

3.	After you log in to your managed server, browse to locate the Magento archive on your local system.

	On the remote system, browse to locate the `public_html` directory.

	The following figure shows an example.
