If you need to programmatically access product recommendations for your storefront, use the [Recommendations JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magento/recommendations-js-sdk). The SDK is a web services API wrapper that allows you to fetch recommendations programmatically in the browser. With the SDK, you do not need to manage the full lifecycle or understand the complexity of the web services API.
