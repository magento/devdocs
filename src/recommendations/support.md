As we continue to evolve this technology and ensure you are successful in implementing product recommendations, it is critical that we address any issues you encounter and plan for any feature requests.

You can send us feedback by one of the following methods:

-  <a href="mailto:magento-product-recs-feedback@adobe.com">E-mail us</a>

-  Join the conversation on Slack. Customers that have access to the `magentocommeng.slack.com` workspace can <a href="mailto:magento-product-recs-feedback@adobe.com">E-mail us</a> to get access to the private `#product-recs` (private) channel on Magento Community Engineering.

Additionally, see the [troubleshooting]({{ page.baseurl }}/recommendations/troubleshooting.html) section for solutions to common errors.
