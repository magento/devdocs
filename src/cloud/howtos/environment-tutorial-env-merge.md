## Merge an environment {#tut-env-merge}

This tutorial shows how to merge changes from an environment to its parent, which in this case is the master branch. You can, for example, merge code updates, new components, changes to themes, and so on.

You can then optionally delete the environment.

This tutorial shows how to create a sample file and merge it. This tutorial assumes you're already working in an environment; if not, see [Get started with an environment]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/env/environments-start.html#env-start-comm) to create one.

 {:.bs-callout-info}
You _cannot_ merge environment variables because they are not code. You must set the value of environment variables in an environment.

### Get started

To get started:

{% include cloud/cli-get-started.md %}

### Merge an environment

To merge an environment:

1. Add a file named `test.txt` to the environment root directory.

   You can put whatever contents you want; for example, the number `1`

1. Save your changes and exit the text editor.
1. Add, commit, and push your change to the environment:

   ```bash
   git add -A
   ```

   ```bash
   git commit -m "<commit message>"
   ```

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch name>
   ```

   Where `<branch name>` is the Git name of the environment (that is, the environment ID).

1. Merge with the parent environment:

   ```bash
   magento-cloud environment:merge <environment ID>
   ```

   For example,

   ```bash
   magento-cloud environment:merge master
   ```

## Optionally delete the environment {#tut-env-delete}

You need to verify that you do not need an environment before you delete it. You cannot recover a deleted environment later.

 {:.bs-callout-info}
You cannot delete the `master` environment of any project.

You must be a [project administrator]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/user-admin.html#cloud-role-project), [environment administrator]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/user-admin.html#cloud-role-env), or [account owner]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/user-admin.html#cloud-role-acct-owner) to perform this task.

This section discusses how to optionally delete an environment in the following ways:

*  Make the environment *inactive* but let it remain in the project
*  Delete the environment entirely and remove it from the project

To delete a environment:

1. Log in to your project if you haven't already done so.
1. Fetch branches from the origin server.

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

1. To delete the branch entirely (removing it from the project), check out the branch.

   ```bash
   magento-cloud environment:checkout <environment ID>
   ```

1. Delete the environment:

   ```bash
   magento-cloud environment:delete <environment ID>
   ```

   For example, to delete the `deleteme` environment:

   ```bash
   magento-cloud environment:delete deleteme
   ```

   To delete more than one environment:

   ```bash
   magento-cloud environment:delete <environment ID> <environmentID>
   ```

   For additional options, see the command-line help:

   ```bash
   magento-cloud environment:delete --help
   ```

1. Answer the prompt:

   ```terminal
   Are you sure you want to delete the remote Git branch deleteme? [Y/n]
   ```

   A `Y` answer makes the branch inactive but leaves it in the project.

1. Answer the prompt:

   ```terminal
   Delete the remote Git branch too? [Y/n]
   ```

   A `Y` answer completely removes the branch from the project.

Wait for the environment to delete.

 {:.bs-callout-info}
To activate the environment later, use the `magento-cloud environment:activate` command.
