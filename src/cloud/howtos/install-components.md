This information includes information for [adding extensions](#install) to {{site.data.var.ece}}, [managing](#manage) enabled and disabled extensions, and [upgrading extension code](#update).

When adding extensions to {{site.data.var.ece}}, you should add the code to a Git branch, test in Integration, deploy and test in Staging, before finally pushing and using in Production.

Extensions include the following:

*  Modules to extend Magento capabilities, with options through Magento Marketplace and directly through company sites
*  Themes to change the look and feel of your storefronts
*  Language packages to localize the storefront and Admin

These instructions walk through extension installation purchased from Magento Marketplace. You can use the same procedure to install any extension with the extension's Composer name. To find it, open the extension's `composer.json` file and note the values for `"name"` and `"version"`.

We also include instructions for [updating extensions](#update).

## Create a branch for adding or updating the extension {#getstarted}

We recommend using a branch for adding or updating, configuring, and testing your extension.

{% include cloud/cli-get-started.md %}

## Install an extension {#install}
[Extension installation](#install) uses the following steps:

1. Purchase an extension or module from [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com) or another site.
1. [Create a branch](#getstarted) to work with the files.
1. [Get the extension's Composer name](#compose) and version from your purchase history.
1. In your local {{site.data.var.ece}} project, [update the Magento `composer.json`](#update) file with the name and version of the extension and add the code to Git. The code builds, deploys, and is available through the environment.
1. [Verify](#verify) the extension installed properly.

### Step 1: Get the extension's Composer name and version {#compose}

If you already know the extension's Composer name and version, skip this step and continue with [Update Magento's `composer.json`](#update).

{% include cloud/composer-name.md %}

### Step 2: Update Magento's `composer.json` {#update}

When adding the module to `composer.json`, the file [`app/etc/config.php`]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/v2.3/config-guide/config/config-php.html) will also be updated. This file includes a list of installed modules, themes, and language packages,  shared configuration settings. This file also includes [Configuration Management]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/live/sens-data-over.html) (Pipeline Deployment) values too.

To update `composer.json`:

1. If you haven't done so already, change to your environment root directory.
1. Enter the following commands to update it:

    ```bash
    composer require <component-name>:<version> --no-update
    ```

    ```bash
    composer update
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    composer require pixlee/magento2:1.0.1 --no-update
    ```

    ```bash
    composer update
    ```

1. Wait for project dependencies to update.
1. Enter the following commands in the order shown to commit your changes, including `composer.lock`:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    ```

    ```bash
    git commit -m "<message>"
    ```

    ```bash
    git push magento <environment ID>
    ```

If there are errors, see [extension deployment failure]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/trouble/trouble_comp-deploy-fail.html).

{:.bs-callout-warning}
When installing and adding the module, you must add the `composer.lock` to your Git branch for deployment. If the extension is not in the file, the extension won't load in {{site.data.var.ece}}. This ensures when the `composer install` command is used, the extension properly loads. This command uses the `composer.lock` file.

### Step 3: Verify the extension {#verify}

To verify the extension installed properly, you can check its functionality in the Magento Admin or you can view enabled modules using the CLI:

1. Open a terminal.
1. [Checkout the branch]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/before/before-setup-env-2_clone.html#branch) where the module is installed.
1. List all enabled modules:

    ```bash
    php bin/magento module:status
    ```

1. Verify the extension is listed.

The extension name is in the format `<VendorName>_<ComponentName>`. It will not be in the same format as the Composer name.

## Manage extensions {#manage}

To manage your extensions, you can enable and disable or change settings per environment.

### Enable and disable extensions {#enable-disable}

To enable or disable extensions, you must begin those changes on your local in a branch. You should never enable or disable extensions directly on your environments. These instructions assume you have `config.php` in your Git branch and implementation. If you do not use [Configuration Management]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/live/sens-data-over.html) or `config.php`, we strongly recommend you do.

Trying to enable and disable extensions not following this method can lead to permissions and other issues.

1. [Work in a branch](#getstarted) to update `config.php`.
1. In a terminal, access your local development environment.
1. List all module.

    ```bash
    php bin/magento module:status
    ```

1. Enable a module.This command updates the `config.php` file with the enabled status of the module.

    ```bash
    php bin/magento module:enable <module name>
    ```

1. Disable a module. This command updates the `config.php` file with the disable status of the module.

    ```bash
    php bin/magento module:disable <module name>
    ```

1. Verify the status of a module:

    ```bash
    php bin/magento module:status
    ```

1. Push your updates to the Git branch.
1. [Complete deployment]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/live/stage-prod-live.html) to Integration for testing, then Staging for testing, and finally Production.

### Modify configurations {#configure}

You update configurations according to [Configuration Management]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/live/sens-data-over.html#cloud-clp-settings) for `config.php`.

## Upgrade an extension

You should have a branch to work in when updating your extension. These instructions use composer to update the files. Before you continue, you must:

*  Know the extension's Composer name and version
*  Know the extension is compatible with your project and {{site.data.var.ece}} version. In particular, check the required PHP version.

To update an extension:

1. If you haven't done so already, change to your environment root directory.
1. Open `composer.json` in a text editor.
1. Locate your extension and update the version.
1. Save your changes to `composer.json` and exit the text editor.
1. Update project dependencies:

    ```bash
    composer update
    ```

1. Enter the following commands in the order to commit the changes and deploy the project, including `composer.lock`:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "<message>"
    git push origin <environment ID>
    ```

1. Wait for the project to deploy and verify in your environment.

If there are errors, see [Component deployment failure]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/trouble/trouble_comp-deploy-fail.html).
