The Cloud infrastructure scales according to your resource needs to achieve greater efficiency. The {{site.data.var.ece}} monitors your applications and can adjust capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance. Converting to this architecture helps to mitigate problems, such as latency or large spikes in traffic.

The scaled architecture is available for {{site.data.var.ece}} accounts with the Pro48 cluster or greater.

## Split architecture

Historically, the Pro architecture consisted of 3 nodes, each containing a full tech stack. Now, there is a  scalable infrastructure that provides a tiered solution with a minimum of 6 nodes: 3 nodes for the core database and other services and 3 nodes for the web server. This split architecture provides the capability to scale tiers independently to achieve an optimal balance of performance. The **core** tier scales vertically (increases in size), and the **web** tier scales horizontally (increases instance count) and vertically (changes instance type and size).

Scaling must use the same instance type and size for each node:

-  `M5 or M5n instances` for each core node
-  `C5 instances` for each web node

### Core tier scaling

There are 3 nodes (core nodes) for the database and included services, such as ElasticSearch, MariaDB, and Redis. When the core tier approaches capacity, the only way to scale is to increase the server size, such as boosting the CPU power and memory. Capacity is limited to the size of the node that is available. Because the database cluster is designed for high availability, you cannot scale horizontally in a reliable way with the technologies used.

![Core tier scaling]

Consider an example that the core node instance type is _m5.2xlarge_ with 32Gb RAM. A service, such as the database, uses a considerable amount of memory (30Gb). Scaling to the next available instance size _m5.4xlarge_ provides 64Gb RAM, which doubles the memory and accommodates the growing needs of the database.

You can further optimize the performance of the core tier by routing traffic based on the node type. By default, the database node is isolated from the web traffic. As an example, you can choose to serve web traffic on the database node.

### Web tier scaling

There are 3 nodes (web nodes) for php-fpm processing and web traffic. In addition to vertical scaling by increasing power and memory, the web tier can scale horizontally by adding extra web servers to an existing cluster when constricted at the PHP level.

![Web tier scaling]

This complements the vertical scaling provided by the core tier. As the core tier scales in size and power to accommodate a growing database and increase in service usage, the web tier scales in size and power, and even instances, to accommodate growing process and traffic requirements.

Consider an example that the web node instance type is _C5.2xlarge with 8 CPU and 16Gb RAM_. The number of requests to the site increased greatly. You can add an additional C5.2xlarge node to handle the increase in php-fpm processes or you can change each instance type to _C5.4xlarge with 16 CPU and 32Gb RAM_. Adding an additional node reduces the risk of insufficient surge capacity.

## Project structure

Minimally, Pro projects with the Scaled architecture have 6 nodes available.

-  3 web nodes c5.2xlarge (8 CPU, 16 Gb RAM)
-  3 core nodes m5.2xlarge (8 CPU, 32 Gb RAM)

Each project is unique, however, and requires performance monitoring to properly analyze resource management. Each account includes the [New Relic Infrastructure service][nri], which automatically connects with the application data and performance analytics to provide dynamic server monitoring. As a resource reaches capacity or a degradation in performance, you can create a request to scale your infrastructure to meet the demand.

### SSH access

Certain files and logs, such as the `/app/<project-id>/var/log` directory, are not shared between nodes. Each node has a unique SSH access. You can not use the Magento Cloud CLI to log in to the core or web nodes, but you can find the node addresses in the [SSH Access list] in the Project Web UI.

```bash
ssh <node>.<project-ID>-<environment>-<user-ID>@ssh.<region>.magento.com
```

-  `node` 1 to 3—Addresses to access the core nodes
-  `node` 4 to _n_—Addresses to access the web nodes

Example response as you log in to a **core node** includes the _unified_ role:

```terminal
 __  __                   _          ___ _             _
|  \/  |__ _ __ _ ___ _ _| |_ ___   / __| |___ _  _ __| |
| |\/| / _` / _` / -_) ' \  _/ _ \ | (__| / _ \ || / _` |
|_|  |_\__,_\__, \___|_||_\__\___/  \___|_\___/\_,_\__,_|
            |___/

 Welcome to Magento Cloud.

 This is server unique-server-id, role project-id:unified.

project-id@server-id:~$
```

Example response as you log in to a **web node** includes the _web_ role:

```terminal
 __  __                   _          ___ _             _
|  \/  |__ _ __ _ ___ _ _| |_ ___   / __| |___ _  _ __| |
| |\/| / _` / _` / -_) ' \  _/ _ \ | (__| / _ \ || / _` |
|_|  |_\__,_\__, \___|_||_\__\___/  \___|_\___/\_,_\__,_|
            |___/

 Welcome to Magento Cloud.

 This is server unique-server-id, role project-id:web.

project-id@server-id:~$
```
{:.no-copy}

### Log locations

The log locations vary slightly depending on the node. For example, a database log, such as the **MySQL error log**, is available on a core node (`/var/log/mysql/mysql-error.log`), but it is not available on a web node.
