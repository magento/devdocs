After you enable and verify the Fastly service in your Staging and Production environments, you can review and customize cache configuration settings like enabling force TLS to redirect HTTP requests to Fastly, updating purge settings, enabling basic authentication to password-protect your site during development, and setting up GeoIP support.

The following sections provide an overview and instructions for configuring some cache settings. You can find additional information about the available configuration options in the [Fastly CDN Module for Magento 2](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/tree/master/Documentation) documentation.

## Force TLS

Fastly provides the _Force TLS_ option to redirect unencrypted requests (HTTP) to Fastly. After your Staging or Production environment has been provisioned with a [valid SSL/TLS certificate]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/cdn/configure-fastly.html#provision-ssltls-certificates), you can update the Fastly configuration for your store to enable the Force TLS option. See the Fastly [Force TLS guide](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/blob/master/Documentation/Guides/FORCE-TLS.md) in the Fastly CDN Module for Magento 2 documentation.

{:.bs-callout-info}
Enabling the Force TLS option is a recommended best practice for Magento Commerce stores.

## Extend Fastly timeout

The Fastly service configuration specifies a default timeout period of 180 seconds for HTTPS requests to the Magento Admin. Any request processing that exceeds the timeout period returns a 503 error.
As a result, you could receive 503 errors when attempting operations that require lengthy processing, or when trying to perform bulk operations.

If you need to complete bulk actions that take longer than 3 minutes, you can prevent 503 errors by changing the _Admin path timeout_ value.

{:.procedure}
To extend the Fastly timeout for the Magento Admin:

{% include cloud/admin-ui-login-step.md %}

1. Click **Stores** > Settings > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **System** and expand **Full Page Cache**.

1. In the *Fastly Configuration* section, expand **Advanced**.

1. Set the **Admin path timeout** value in seconds. This value cannot be more than 10 minutes (600 seconds).

1. Click **Save Config** at the top of the page.

1. After the page reloads, click **Upload VCL to Fastly** in the *Fastly Configuration* section.

Fastly retrieves the Magento Admin path for generating the VCL file from the `app/etc/env.php` configuration file.

## Configure purge options

Fastly provides multiple types of purge options on your Magento Cache Management page, including purging product category, product assets, and content. When enabled, Fastly watches for events to automatically purge those caches. If you disable a purge option, you can manually purge Fastly caches after finishing updates through the Cache Management page.

The options include:

-  **Purge category**–Purges product category content (not product content) when you add and update a single product. You may want to keep this disabled and enable purge product, which purges products and product categories.
-  **Purge product**–Purges all product and product category content when saving a single modification to a product. Enabling purge product can be helpful to immediately get updates to customers when changing a price, adding a product option, and when product inventory is out-of-stock.
-  **Purge CMS page**–Purges page content when updating and adding pages to the Magento CMS. For example, you may want to purge when updating your Terms and Conditions or Return policy. If you rarely make these changes, you could disable automatic purging.
-  **Soft purge**–Sets changed content to stale and purges according to the stale timing. In combination with the stale timings your customers will be served stale content very fast while Fastly is updating the content in the background.

![Configure purge options]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud/cloud_fastly-purgeoptions.png){:width="650px"}

{:.procedure}
To configure Fastly purge options:

1. In the *Fastly Configuration* section, expand **Advanced** to display the purge options.

1. For each purge option, select **Yes** to enable automatic purging, or **No** to disable automatic purging.

   When you disable a purge option, you must manually purge the cache for that category from the _Cache Management_ page.

1. Click **Save Config** at the top of the page.

1. After the page reloads, click **Upload VCL to Fastly** in the *Fastly Configuration* section.

For more information, see [the Fastly configuration options](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/blob/21b61c8189971275589219d418332798efc7db41/Documentation/CONFIGURATION.md#further-configuration-options).

## Configure GeoIP handling

The Fastly module includes GeoIP handling to automatically redirect visitors or provide a list of stores matching their obtained country code. If you already use a Magento extension for GeoIP handling, you may need to verify the features with Fastly options.

{:.procedure}
To set up GeoIp handling:

{% include cloud/admin-ui-login-step.md %}

1. Click **Stores** > Settings > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **System** and expand **Full Page Cache**.

1. In the *Fastly Configuration* section, expand **Advanced**.

1. Scroll down and select **Yes** to **Enable GeoIP**. Additional configuration options display.

1. For GeoIP Action, select if the visitor is automatically redirected with **Redirect** or provided a list of stores to select from with **Dialog**.

1. For **Country Mapping**, click **Add** to enter a two-letter country code to map with a specific Magento store from a list. For a list of country codes, see [this site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).

   ![Add GeoIP country maps]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud/cloud_fastly-geo-code.png)

1. Click **Save Config** at the top of the page.

1. After page reload, click **Upload VCL to Fastly** in the *Fastly Configuration* section.

Fastly also provides a series of [geolocation-related VCL features](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/vcl/geolocation-related-vcl-features) for customized geolocation coding.

## Enable Fastly Edge modules

Fastly Edge Modules is a flexible framework that allows definition of UI components and associated VCL code through a template. These modules make it easy to customize and extend the Fastly service configuration through the user interface instead of using custom VCL snippets.

Edge modules allow you to enable specific functionality like CORS headers, Magento Cloud Sitemap rewrites, and to configure integration between your Magento store and other CMSs or back ends.

You must turn on the _Enable Fastly Edge modules_ option to access the Edge Modules menu to view, configure, and manage the available Edge modules. See [Fastly Edge Modules](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/blob/master/Documentation/Guides/Edge-Modules/EDGE-MODULES.md) in the Fastly CDN module documentation.

## Configure back ends and Origin shielding

Back-end settings provide fine tuning for Fastly performance with Origin shielding and timeouts. A _back end_ is a specific location (IP or domain) with configured Origin shield and timeout settings for checking and providing cached content.

_Origin shielding_ routes all requests for your store to a specific Point of Presence (POP). When a request is received, the POP checks for cached content and provides it. If it is not cached, it continues to the Shield POP, then to the Origin server which caches the content. The shields reduce traffic directly to the origin.

The default Fastly VCL code specifies default values for Origin shielding and timeouts for your {{ site.data.var.ece }} sites. We recommend using the default values. In some case, you might need to modify the default values. For example, if you are getting a lot of time to first byte (TTFB) errors, you might need to adjust the _first byte timeout_ value.

 {:.bs-callout-info}
If you need to integrate additional back ends into your site, such as a back end to serve blog content from a [Wordpress]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/cdn/fastly-vcl-wordpress.html) site, you must customize your Fastly service configuration to add the back end and handle the redirects from your {{ site.data.var.ee }} store to the Wordpress back end. For details, see [Fastly Edge Modules - Other CMS/Backend integration](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/blob/master/Documentation/Guides/Edge-Modules/EDGE-MODULE-OTHER-CMS-INTEGRATION.md) in the Fastly module documentation.

{:.procedure}
To review the back end setting configuration:

{% include cloud/admin-ui-login-step.md %}

1. Click **Stores** > Settings > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **System** and expand **Full Page Cache**.

1. Expand the **Fastly Configuration** section.

1. Expand **Backend settings** and click the gear to check the default back end. A modal opens that shows current settings with options to change them.

   ![Modify the back end]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud/cloud_fastly-backend.png){:width="600px"}

1. Select the **Shield** location (or datacenter) closest to your Cloud service region.

   For example, if your project is hosted on AWS, then the Staging is on the west coast of the United States (`us-west-1`); therefore, you would select the `sjc-ca-us` Fastly shield location. This is the POP that provides caching services.

   The following list shows which Fastly shield locations to use based on AWS regions:

   -  ap-east-1 => hongkong-hk
   -  ap-northeast-1 => tyo-tokyo-jp, hnd-tokyo-jp
   -  ap-northeast-2 => tyo-tokyo-jp, hnd-tokyo-jp
   -  ap-southeast-1 => singapore-sg
   -  ap-southeast-2 => sydney-au
   -  ap-south-1 => singapore-sg
   -  ca-central-1 => yul-montreal-ca, iad-va-us, dca-dc-us, bwi-va-us
   -  eu-central-1 => frankfurt-de, hhn-frankfurt-de
   -  eu-north-1 => stockholm-bma
   -  eu-west-1 => london-uk, london_city-uk
   -  eu-west-2 => london-uk, london_city-uk
   -  eu-west-3 => cdg-par-fr
   -  sa-east-1 => gru-br-sa
   -  us-east-1 => iad-va-us, dca-dc-us, bwi-va-us
   -  us-east-2 => iad-va-us, dca-dc-us, bwi-va-us
   -  us-west-1 => sjc-ca-us, pao-ca-us
   -  us-west-2 => sea-wa-us

1. Modify the timeout values (in microseconds) for the connection to the shield, time between bytes, and time for the first byte. We recommend keeping the default timeout settings.

1. Optionally, select to **Activate the backend and Shield after editing or saving**.

1. Click **Upload** to save your changes and upload them to the Fastly servers.

1. In the Magento Admin, click **Save Config**.

For more information, see the [Backend settings guide](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/blob/21b61c8189971275589219d418332798efc7db41/Documentation/Guides/BACKEND-SETTINGS.md) in the Fastly module documentation.

## Basic authentication {#basic-auth}

Basic authentication is a feature to protect every page and asset on your site
with a username and password. We **do not recommend** activating basic
authentication on your Production environment. You can configure it on Staging
to protect your site during the development process. See the [Basic Authentication Guide](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/blob/master/Documentation/Guides/BASIC-AUTH.md) in the Fastly CDN module documentation.

If you add user access and enable basic authentication on Staging, you can still
access the Magento Admin without requiring additional credentials.

## Create custom VCL snippets

Fastly supports a customized version of the Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) to customize the Fastly service configuration. For example, you can allow, block, or redirect access for specific users or IPs using VCL code blocks in combination with edge and ACL dictionaries.

For instructions to create custom VCL snippets, edge dictionaries, and ACLs, see [Custom Fastly VCL snippets]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/cdn/cloud-vcl-custom-snippets.html).

{:.bs-callout-info}
Before adding custom VCL code, edge dictionaries, and ACLs to your Fastly module configuration, verify that the Fastly caching service works with the default configuration. See [Set up Fastly]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/cdn/configure-fastly.html).

## Manage domains

For Starter projects, use the _Domains_ option to add and manage the Fastly domain configuration for your store. Before adding a domain to your project, you must submit a [Magento Support ticket](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251) to add the domain to your Cloud configuration. You can add the domain to Fastly after Magento confirms your request.

{:.bs-callout-info}
For Pro plan projects, you must submit a [Magento support ticket](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251) to update the Fastly domain configuration for your project.

{:.procedure}
To manage Fastly domain configuration from the Magento Admin:

{% include cloud/admin-ui-login-step.md %}

1. Click **Stores** > Settings > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **System** and expand **Full Page Cache**.

1. In the Magento Admin _Fastly Configuration_ section, click **Domains**.

1. Click **Manage Domains** to open the Domains page.

1. Add the top-level and subdomain names for the stores in the Cloud environment.

   You can only specify domains that have already been added to your Cloud infrastructure configuration.

   ![Add Fastly domain configuration for Starter]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud/cloud-fastly-starter-activate-domain.png){:width="650px"}

1. Click **Activate** to update the Fastly domain configuration.

## Enable Maintenance Mode

Use the _Maintenance Mode_ option to allow administrative access to your site from specified IP addresses while returning an error page for all other requests.

{:.procedure}
To enable Maintenance mode with Administrative access:

1. Open the _Fastly configuration_ section in the Magento Admin UI.

1. In the _Edge ACL_ section, update the `maint_allow` access control list (ACL) with the administrative IP addresses that can access your store while it is in Maintenance mode.

   ![Update IP maintenance mode allow list]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud/cloud_fastly-maint-allowlist.png){:width="650px"}

1. In the _Maintenance Mode_ section, click **Enable Maintenance Mode**.

   After you enable maintenance mode, all traffic is blocked except requests from the IP addresses in the `maint_allowlist` ACL. You can update the `maint_allowlist` to change the IP addresses in the ACL.

   For detailed configuration instructions, see the [Maintenance Mode guide](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/blob/master/Documentation/Guides/MAINTENANCE-MODE.md) in the Fastly CDN for Magento 2 module documentation.
