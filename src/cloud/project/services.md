The `services.yaml` file defines the services supported and used by {{site.data.var.ece}}, such as MySQL, Redis, and ElasticSearch. You do not need to subscribe to external service providers. This file is in the `.magento` directory of your project.

The deploy script uses the configuration files in the `.magento` directory to provision the environment with the configured services. A service becomes available to your application if it is included in the [`relationships`]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/magento-app-properties.html#relationships) property of the `.magento.app.yaml` file. The `services.yaml` file contains the _type_ and _disk_ values. Service type defines the service _name_ and _version_. Changing a service configuration causes a deployment to provision the environment with the updated services.

This affects the following environments:

-  All Starter environments including Production `master`
-  Pro Integration environments

{%include cloud/note-pro-using-yaml-support.md%}

## Default and supported services

We support and deploy the following services:

-  [`mysql`]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/services-mysql.html)
-  [`redis`]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/services-redis.html)
-  [`elasticsearch`]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/services-elastic.html)
-  [`rabbitmq`]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/services-rabbit.html)

You can view default versions and disk values in the the current, [default `services.yaml` file](https://github.com/magento/magento-cloud/blob/master/.magento/services.yaml). The following sample shows the `mysql`, `redis`, and `elasticsearch` services defined in the `services.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
mysql:
    type: mysql:<version>
    disk: 2048

redis:
    type: redis:<version>

elasticsearch:
    type: elasticsearch:<version>
    disk: 1024
```

## Service values

You must provide the <service-id> and service type configuration `type: <name>:<version>`.
If the service uses persistent storage, then you must provide a _disk_ value.

Use the following format:

```yaml
<service-id>:
    type: <name>:<version>
    disk: <value-MB>
```

### `service-id`

The `service-id` value identifies the service in the project. You can only use lower case alphanumeric characters: `a` to `z` and `0` to `9`, such as `redis`.

This _service-id_ value is used in the [`relationships`]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/magento-app-properties.html#relationships) property of the `.magento.app.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
relationships:
    redis: "<name>:redis"
```

You can name multiple instances of each service type. For example, we could use multiple Redis instances—one for session and one for cache.

```yaml
redis:
    type: redis:<version>

redis2:
    type: redis:<version>
```

Renaming a service in the `services.yaml` file **permanently removes** the following:

-  The existing service before creating a new service with the new name you specify.
-  All existing data for the service is removed. We strongly recommend you [snapshot your environment]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/project-webint-snap.html) before you change the name of an existing service.

### `type`

The `type` value specifies the service name and version. For example:

```yaml
mysql:
    type: mysql:10.2
```

Use [`Service versions`](#service-versions) table to see supported services and their versions

### `disk`

The `disk` value specifies the size of the persistent disk storage (in MB) to allocate to the service. Services that use persistent storage, such as MySQL, must provide a disk value. Services that use memory instead of persistent storage, such as Redis, do not require a disk value.

```yaml
mysql:
    type: mysql:10.2
    disk: 2048
```

The current default storage amount per project is 5GB, or 5120MB. You can distribute this amount between your application and each of its services.

## Service relationships

In {{ site.data.var.ece }} projects, service [*relationships*]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/magento-app-properties.html#relationships) configured in the `.magento.app.yaml` file determine which services are available to your application.

You can retrieve the configuration data for all service relationships from the [`$MAGENTO_CLOUD_RELATIONSHIPS`]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/env/variables-cloud.html) environment variable. The configuration data includes service name, type, and version along with any required connection details such as port number and login credentials.

{:.procedure}
To verify relationships in local environment:

1. In your local environment, show the relationships for the active environment.

   ```bash
   magento-cloud relationships
   ```

1. Confirm the `service` and `type` from the response. The response provides connection information, such as the IP address and port number.

   **Abbreviated sample response**:

   ```terminal
   redis:
       -
   ...
           type: 'redis:3.8'
           port: 6379
   elasticsearch:
       -
   ...
           type: 'elasticsearch:6.6'
           port: 9200
   database:
       -
   ...
           type: 'mysql:10.2'
           port: 3306
   ```

{:.procedure}
To verify relationships in remote environments:

1. Use SSH to log in to the remote environment.

1. List the relationships configuration data for all services configured in the environment.

   ```bash
   echo $MAGENTO_CLOUD_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 -d | json_pp
   ```

   or, use the following {{ site.data.var.ct }} CLI command to view relationships:

   ```bash
   php ./vendor/bin/ece-tools env:config:show services
   ```

1. Confirm the `service` and `type` from the response. The response provides connection information, such as the IP address and port number and any required username and password credentials.

## Service versions

{%include cloud/note-cloud-services-compatibility.md%}

The following table lists the services used in {{site.data.var.ece}} and their version compatibility with the [Magento Cloud template](https://github.com/magento/magento-cloud).

{:.error-table}
Service   |  Magento 2.4  |Magento 2.3  | Magento 2.2
--------- | ------------- |-------------| ------------
`elasticsearch` | 7.7, 7.9 | **Magento version 2.3.5 and later**— 5.2, 6.5, 6.8, 7.5, 7.7, 7.9<br>**Magento version 2.3.1 to 2.3.4**— 5.2, 6.5<br>**Magento version 2.3.0**— 5.2  | **Magento version 2.2.8 and later**— 5.2, 6.5 <br>**Magento version 2.2.0 to 2.2.7**— 5.2
`mariadb` | 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 | **Magento version 2.3.0 to 2.3.5**–10.1 to 10.2<br> | 10.1 to 10.2

`rabbitmq`| 3.8 | **Magento version 2.3.5**–3.8<br>**Magento version 2.3.3 - 2.3.4**— 3.7, 3.8<br>**Magento version 2.3.0 to 2.3.3**— 3.7     | 3.5
`redis`   | 5.x, 6.x | **Magento version 2.3.1 - 2.3.7**–4.x, 5.x, 6.x<br>**Magento version 2.3.0**— 3.2, 4.0 | 3.2, 4.0, 5.0, 6.x
`varnish` | 6.x | **Magento version 2.3.3 to 2.3.5**— 4.0, 5.0, 6.2<br>**Magento version 2.3.0 to 2.3.2**— 4.0, 5.0 | 4.0, 5.0<br>**Note:** On Cloud projects, you must use the [Fastly service]({{site.baseurl}}/cloud/cdn/cloud-fastly.html) for caching. Varnish is available only for local development.

{:.bs-callout-info}
When you set up the Elasticsearch service, check to ensure that you use a version that is compatible with the installed [Elasticsearch PHP](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php) client. See [Check Elasticsearch software compatibility]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/services-elastic.html#elasticsearch-software-compatibility).

### Software EOL checks

During the deployment process, {{site.data.var.ct}} checks installed service versions against the end-of-life (EOL) dates for each service.

-  If a service version is within three months of the EOL date, a notification displays in the deploy log.
-  If the EOL date is in the past, a warning notification displays.

To maintain Magento store security, update installed software versions before they reach EOL. You can review the EOL dates in the [{{ site.data.var.ct }} `eol.yaml` file](https://github.com/magento/ece-tools/blob/develop/config/eol.yaml).

## Change service version

You can upgrade the installed service version for compatibility with the Magento version deployed in your Cloud environment.

You cannot downgrade the service version for an installed service directly. However, you can create a new service with the required version. See [Downgrade service version](#downgrade-version).

Use the [Service versions](#service-versions) table to check service version compatibility by Magento version. Note that some service versions supported by {{ site.data.var.ee }} are not supported on {{ site.data.var.ece }}.

### Upgrade installed service version

You can upgrade the installed service version by updating the service configuration in the `services.yaml` file.

1. Change the [`type`](#type) value for the service in the `.magento/services.yaml` file:

   > Original service definition

   ```yaml
   mysql:
       type: mysql:10.2
       disk: 2048
   ```

   > Updated service definition

   ```yaml
   mysql:
       type: mysql:10.3
       disk: 2048
   ```

1. Add, commit, and push your code changes.

   ```bash
   git add -A
   ```

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Upgrade MySQL from MariaDB 10.2 to 10.3."
   ```

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

### Downgrade version

You cannot downgrade an installed service directly. You have two options:

-  Rename an existing service with the new version, which removes the existing service and data, and adds a new one.

-  Create a new service and save the data from the existing service.

When you change the service version, you must update the service configuration in the `services.yaml` file, and update the relationships in the `.magento.app.yaml` file.

{:.procedure}
To downgrade a service version by renaming an existing service:

1. Rename the existing service in the `.magento/services.yaml` file and change the version.

   {:.bs-callout-warning}
   Renaming an existing service replaces it and deletes all data. If you need to retain the data, create a new service instead of renaming the existing one.

   For example, to downgrade the MariaDB version for the _mysql_ service from version 10.3 to 10.2, change the existing  _service-id_ and _type_ configuration.

   > Original `services.yaml` definition

     ```yaml
     mysql:
         type: mysql:10.4
         disk: 2048
     ```

   > New `services.yaml` definition

     ```yaml
     mysql2:
          type: mysql:10.3
          disk: 2048
     ```

1. Update the relationships in the `.magento.app.yaml` file.

   > Original `.magento.app.yaml` configuration

   ```yaml
   relationships:
       database: "mysql:mysql"
   ```

   > Updated `.magento.app.yaml` configuration

   ```yaml
   relationships:
       database: "mysql2:mysql"
   ```

1. Add, commit, and push your code changes.

{:.procedure}
To downgrade a service by creating an additional service:

1. Add an additional service definition to the `services.yaml` file for your project with the downgraded version specification. See _mysql2_ in the following example:

   > services.yaml

   ```yaml
   mysql:
       type: mysql:10.4
       disk: 2048
   mysql2:
       type: mysql:10.3
       disk: 2048
   ```

1. Change the relationships configuration in the `.magento.app.yaml` file to use the new service.

   > Original `.magento.app.yaml` configuration

     ```yaml
     relationships:
         database: "mysql:mysql"
     ```

   > New `.magento.app.yaml` configuration

     ```yaml
     relationships:
         database: "mysql2:mysql"
     ```

1. Add, commit, and push your code changes.
