The [Magento Cloud Patches](https://github.com/magento/magento-cloud-patches) package
delivers Magento patches and hot fixes, which improve the integration of all `{{site.data.var.ee}}` versions with Cloud environments and supports quick delivery of critical fixes. It also delivers [custom patches]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/v2.3/comp-mgr/patching.html#custom-patches) that you add to your {{site.data.var.ece}} project.

The `{{site.data.var.mcp}}` package is a dependency for the `{{site.data.var.ct}}` package and is installed or updated when you install or update `{{site.data.var.ct}}`. You can also use `{{site.data.var.mcp}}` as a stand-alone package to apply patches to an existing {{site.data.var.ee}} project.

When you deploy changes to the remote environment, `{{site.data.var.ct}}` uses `{{site.data.var.mcp}}` to check for pending patches and applies them automatically in the following order:

1. Apply Magento-provided patches included in the `{{site.data.var.mcp}}` package.
1. Apply custom patches in the `/m2-hotfixes` directory in alphabetical order by patch name.

You can also apply patches manually.

{:.bs-callout-info}
All patch file names must end with the `.patch` extension.

## Prerequisite

{% include cloud/note-upgrade.md %}

## Apply patches manually

You can apply patches manually in a local environment and test them before you deploy.

{:.procedure}
To apply {{site.data.var.ece}} patches manually:

1. From the project root, apply the patches.

    ```bash
     php ./vendor/bin/ece-patches apply
    ```

   This command applies Magento patches and any custom patches found in the `m2/hotfixes` directory.

1. Clear the Magento cache.

    ```bash
    php ./bin/magento cache:clean
    ```

    You can also clean the cache using the [Magento Admin Cache Management](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/system/cache-management.html).

1. Test the patches, and make any necessary changes to custom patches.

## Apply a custom patch

When you deploy, `{{site.data.var.ct}}` applies all Magento patches and any custom patches that you add to the `/m2-hotfixes` directory in the Magento project root.

{:.bs-callout-info}
All patch files must end with the `.patch` extension.

{:.procedure}
To apply and test a custom patch:

1. In the project root, create a directory called `m2-hotfixes` if it does not exist

    ```bash
    mkdir m2-hotfixes
    ```

1. Copy the patch file to the `/m2-hotfixes` directory.

    {:.bs-callout-info}
    Make sure to test all patches in a pre-production environment.  For Magento Cloud, new branches can be created with `magento-cloud environment:branch <branch-name>`

## Apply patches to a Magento enterprise or open source project

You can use `{{site.data.var.mcp-prod}}` as a stand-alone package to apply Magento patches and hot fixes to an Magento project that is not deployed on the Cloud platform.

{:.procedure}
To use {{ site.data.var.mcp }} as a stand-alone package:

1. Add the {{site.data.var.mcp}} package to your `composer.json` file.

    ```bash
    composer require magento/magento-cloud-patches
    ```

1. From the project root, apply the patches.

    ```bash
     php ./vendor/bin/ece-patches apply
    ```

   This command applies Magento patches and any custom patches found in the `m2/hotfixes` directory.

1. Clear the Magento cache.

    ```bash
    php ./bin/magento cache:clean
    ```

    You can also clean the cache using the [Magento Admin Cache Management](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/system/cache-management.html).

1. Test the patches, and make any necessary changes to custom patches.
