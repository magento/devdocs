When you update {{site.data.var.ct}}, you also update the other [{{site.data.var.csuite}} packages], which are dependencies for {{site.data.var.ct}}.

**Prerequisites**:

-  Before you update `{{site.data.var.ct}}`, review the [{{site.data.var.csuite}} release notes][{{site.data.var.csuite}} packages].
-  If you are updating from `{{site.data.var.ct}}` 2002.0.22 or earlier to 2002.1.0, review [backward incompatible changes] and make any required changes to your {{site.data.var.ece}} project.
-  Review [Upgrades and Patches] to determine the {{site.data.var.ct}} versions compatible with your {{site.data.var.ece}} project.
-  You must use a version of {{site.data.var.ece}} that supports the `{{site.data.var.ct}}` package. The `composer.json` includes a dependency for the `magento-cloud/metapackage` and the hooks in the  `.magento.app.yaml` file use `{{site.data.var.ct}}`commands to build, deploy, and run post-deploy hooks. If your project does not support {{site.data.var.ct}}, you must [upgrade your project].
