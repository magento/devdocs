You can back up and restore specific environments at any time using a snapshot. Snapshot options are available for all Starter environments and Pro Integration environments. The snapshot feature does not apply to the Pro Staging and Production environments.

The Pro Staging and Production environments receive regular backups for disaster recovery purposes by default, see [Pro Backup & Disaster Recovery]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/architecture/pro-architecture.html#backup-and-disaster-recovery). However, these backups are not publicly accessible because they are stored in a separate system. You can open a ticket to request a backup with a specific date, time, and timezone. Then we can extract it from the external system and provide it to you.

A _snapshot_ is a complete backup of an environment that includes all persistent data from all running services (for example, your MySQL database, Redis, and so on) and any files stored on the mounted volumes. Because an environment deploys as a read-only file system, restoring a snapshot is very fast.

{:.bs-callout-warning}
If you want to rollback to previous code or remove added extensions in an environment, restoring a snapshot is not the recommended method. See [Rollbacks to remove code](#rollback-code). If you must restore an unstable environment that does not have a snapshot, see [Restore an environment]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/env/restore-environment.html).

You have up to **seven days** to _restore_ a snapshot.

Adobe provides two methods for creating and managing snapshots:

-  Project Web Interface
-  Magento Cloud CLI

## Create a snapshot {#create-snapshot}

{:.procedure}
To create a snapshot using the Project Web Interface:

1. Log in to your project.
1. In the left pane, click the name of the environment to back up.
1. In the top pane, click ![Take a snapshot of an environment]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud/cloud_snapshots.png){:width="30px"} (snapshots).
1. Click **Create**.

{:.procedure}
To create a snapshot using the Magento Cloud CLI:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your {{site.data.var.ece}} project.
1. Checkout the environment branch to snapshot.
1. Create the snapshot.

   ```bash
   magento-cloud snapshot:create
   Creating a snapshot of production
   Waiting for the snapshot to complete...
   ```

   The following modifiers further specify how to create the snapshot:

   ```text
   -p, --project=PROJECT          The project ID
   -e, --environment=ENVIRONMENT  The environment ID
   ```

   For a full list of options, enter `magento-cloud snapshot:create --help`.

1. Verify the most recent snapshots.

   ```bash
   magento-cloud snapshots
   ```

   The list returns information about the snapshot status:

   ```terminal
   Finding snapshots for the environment <environment_name>
   +---------------------------+--------------------+----------+----------+---------+
   | Created                   | Snapshot name      | Progress | State    | Result  |
   +---------------------------+--------------------+----------+----------+---------+
   | 2018-04-09T14:43:39-05:00 | <snapshot_ID>.     | 100%     | complete | success |
   +---------------------------+--------------------+----------+----------+---------+
   ```

## Restore a snapshot {#restore-snapshot}

{:.procedure}
To restore a snapshot using the Project Web Interface:

1. Log in to your project.
1. In the left pane, click the name of the environment to restore.
1. In the environment messages, select **snapshot** from the _all types of_ drop-down list.
1. Click **restore** next to the snapshot.
1. Review the Snapshot restore date and click **Restore**.

{:.procedure}
To restore a snapshot using the Magento Cloud CLI:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your {{site.data.var.ece}} project.
1. Checkout the environment branch to restore.
1. List all available snapshots.

   ```bash
   magento-cloud snapshot:list
   ```

   The list returns information about the available snapshots:

   ```terminal
   Finding snapshots for the environment <environment_name>
   +---------------------------+--------------------+----------+----------+---------+
   | Created                   | Snapshot name      | Progress | State    | Result  |
   +---------------------------+--------------------+----------+----------+---------+
   | 2018-04-09T14:43:39-05:00 | <snapshot_ID>.     | 100%     | complete | success |
   +---------------------------+--------------------+----------+----------+---------+
   ```

1. Restore a snapshot using the snapshot ID from the list.

   ```bash
   magento-cloud snapshot:restore <snapshot_id>
   ```

   The following modifiers further specify how to restore the snapshot:

   ```text
   -p, --project=PROJECT          The project ID
   -e, --environment=ENVIRONMENT  The environment ID
   ```

## Dump your database {#db-dump}

You can create a copy of your database using the `{{site.data.var.ct}} db-dump` command. By default, this command creates backups in the `/app/var/dump-main` directory for all database connections that are specified in the environment configuration. For example, if you configured your project to use split databases, the `db-dump` operation creates backups for each of the configured databases.

You can also back up only selected databases by appending the database names to the command, for example:

```bash
php vendor/bin/ece-tools -- main sales
```

For help, use the command: `php vendor/bin/ece-tools db-dump --help`

{:.procedure}
To create a database dump in the Staging or Production environment:

1. [Use SSH to log in to the environment]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/env/environments-ssh.html) that contains the database to copy:

   -  **Staging:** `ssh -A <project ID>_stg@<project ID>.ent.magento.cloud`
   -  **Production:** `ssh -A <project ID>@<project ID>.ent.magento.cloud`

   ```bash
   magento-cloud environment:ssh
   ```

1. Create a backup of the database. To choose a target directory for the DB dump, use the `--dump-directory` option.

   ```bash
   php vendor/bin/ece-tools db-dump
   ```

   Sample response:

   ```terminal
   The db-dump operation switches the site to maintenance mode, stops all active cron jobs and consumer queue processes, and disables cron jobs before starting the dump process.
   Your site will not receive any traffic until the operation completes.
   Do you wish to proceed with this process? (y/N)? y

   ```

{:.bs-callout-info}

-  For Production environments, Adobe recommends completing database dump operations during off-peak hours to minimize service disruptions that occur when the site is in maintenance mode.
-  The `db-dump` command creates an archive in your remote project directory called  `dump-<timestamp>.sql.gz`.
-  If an error occurs during the dump operation, the command deletes the dump file to conserve disk space. Review the logs for details (`var/log/cloud.log`).
-  For Pro Production environments, this command dumps only from one of three high-availability nodes, so production data written to a different node during the dump might not be copied. The command generates a `var/dbdump.lock` file to prevent the command from running on more than one node.

{:.bs-callout-tip}
If you want to push this data into an environment, see [Migrate data and static files]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/live/stage-prod-migrate.html).

## Rollbacks to remove code {#rollback-code}

Adobe recommends creating a snapshot of the environment and a backup of the database prior to deployments.

If you must restore a snapshot specifically to remove new code and added extensions, the process can be complicated depending on the number of changes and when you roll back. Some rollbacks might require database changes.

Specifically for code, you should investigate reverting code changes from your branch before redeploying. If not, every deploy pushes the master branch (code and extensions) to the target environment again. See the [Deployment Process]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/reference/discover-deploy.html).
