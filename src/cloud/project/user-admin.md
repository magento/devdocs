You can manage user access to {{ site.data.var.ece }} projects by assigning users one or more roles. You can add and manage user accounts for the entire project and permissions per available environment.

## Account owner role {#cloud-role-acct-owner}

The Account Owner is the only user with the Account Owner role. This user can perform any task in any project or environment, including deleting it. The account is associated with the email address, name, and information for the person who registered the {{site.data.var.ece}} account through the account creation process.

The account has super user access and additional capabilities for managing all aspects of your project and environments.

## Project-level roles {#cloud-role-project}

You can assign the following project-level roles to users:

-  The **Super user** role grants administrator access to all environments. They can change settings and execute actions on any environment, including creating and restoring snapshots.
-  The **Project reader** role grants view access to all environments in a project. Users with this role cannot execute actions on any environment.

## Environment-level roles {#cloud-role-env}

A project reader can have one of the following roles per environment:

-  The **Admin** role grants access to change settings and execute actions on an environment, including merging with the parent environment.
-  The **Contributor** role grants access to push code to an environment and branch the environment.
-  The **Reader** role, also referred to as the _viewer_ role grants view-only access to an environment.

{:.bs-callout-info}
We recommend that you limit the project Super user role and environment Admin roles to as few users as possible.

## Role management best practices

When a development team works on a project, the team leader can be the project administrator who decides which roles to assign to team members. For example, the team lead might assign one team member as a Contributor to one environment, assign another as an Admin on a different environment, and assign the Reader role to the customer on the `master` environment.`

Assign the Contributor role to users who require view access to an environment as well as the capability to commit code and branch the environment.

{:.bs-callout-warning}
An environment contributor can push code to the environment, but that user role does not have SSH access to the environment. By default, only environment administrators have SSH access. You can change the behavior in `.magento.app.yaml` by specifying `ssh: contributor`.

## Create and manage users

You can create and manage users using the Magento Cloud CLI or the Web Interface.

### Manage users with the CLI {#cloud-user-mg-cli}

You can use the {{site.data.var.ece}} command line client to manage users and integrate this with any other automated system.

Available commands:

-  `magento-cloud user:add`–add a user to the project
-  `magento-cloud user:delete`–delete a user
-  `magento-cloud user:list [users]`–list project users
-  `magento-cloud user:role`–view or change the user role

The following examples show how to add a user and configure the project and environment-level role, and how to how to modify project assignments and assigned user roles.

{:.procedure}
To add a user and assign roles:

1. Add the user:

   ```bash
   magento-cloud user:add
   ```

1. Follow the prompts to specify the user email address and to set the project and environment roles:

  ```terminal
  Enter the user's email address: alice@example.com

  Email address: alice@example.com

  The user's project role can be 'viewer' ('v') or 'admin' ('a').
  Project role [V/a]: a
  The user's environment-level roles can be 'viewer', 'contributor', or 'admin'.
  development environment role [V/c/a]: c
  Summary:
    Email address: alice@example.com
    Project role: contributor
  Adding users can result in additional charges.
  Are you sure you want to add this user? [Y/n]
  Adding the user to the project
  ```
  {:.no-copy}

  After you add the user, Magento sends an email to the specified address with instructions for accessing the {{ site.data.var.ece }} project.

The following example changes the environment-level role that is assigned to a user:

```bash
magento-cloud user:role alice@example.com --level environment --environment development --role admin
```

{:.bs-callout-info}
To list the available `magento-cloud` CLI commands, use the `magento-cloud list` command.

### Manage users with the Web Interface {#cloud-user-webinterface}

{:.procedure}
To create user accounts using the Web Interface:

1. Log in to [your {{site.data.var.ece}} account](https://accounts.magento.cloud).

1. Click the **Projects** tab as the following figure shows.

   ![Click the projects tab to access your Cloud project]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud_account_project.png){:width="550px"}

1. Click the name of your project.

1. Click the configure project button next to project name in the top navigation bar as the following figure shows.

   ![Configure the project]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud_project_gear.png){:width="184px"}

1. In the right pane, click **Add Users**.

   ![Start creating users]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud_project-config.png){:width="500px"}

1. Click **Add User**.

   ![Add users]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud_project-add-superuser.png){:width="500px"}

1. Enter the user e-mail address.

1. Select the access for the account:

   -  For a project administrator account, select the **Super User** checkbox. This provides Admin rights for all settings and environments. If not selected, the account has only view options for all environments on a project.

   -  Select permissions per specific environment (or branch) in the Integration environment: No access, Admin (change settings, execute action, merge code), Contributor (push code), or Reader (view only). As you add active environments, you can modify permissions per user.

1. Click **Add User**.

The user you add receives an email inviting them to join the {{site.data.var.ece}} project with instructions for The registering for an account and verifying their email address.

## Rebuild the environment {#rebuild}

After you add a new user to a Cloud environment using the Project Web UI or the CLI, you must rebuild and deploy the environment.

Rebuilds are triggered when you push a new commit to an environment. To trigger a rebuild without changing any code, use the the following command to to create an empty commit and "force" rebuilding the environment:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "redeploy" && git push <branch name>
```

The new user cannot access the environment until it is successfully built and deployed.

{:.bs-callout-info}
If you add an application user to the Magento Commerce application through the Magento Admin UI, you do not have to redeploy the {{ site.data.var.ece }} environment.
