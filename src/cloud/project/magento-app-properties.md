Use the following properties to build your application configuration file. The `name`, `type`, `disk`, and one `web` or `worker` block is required.

{% include cloud/note-pro-mount-disk-config-yaml-support.md %}

## `name`

The `name` property provides the application name used in the [`routes.yaml`]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/routes.html) file to define the HTTP upstream (by default, `mymagento:http`). For example, if the value of `name` is `app`, you must use `app:http` in the upstream field.

{:.bs-callout-warning}
Do not change the name of the application after it has been deployed. Doing so will result in data loss.

## `type` and `build`

The `type`  and `build` properties provide information about the base container image to build and run the project.

The supported `type` language is [PHP](https://glossary.magento.com/php). Specify the PHP version as follows:

```yaml
type: php:<version>
```

The `build` property determines what happens by default when building the project. The `flavor` specifies a default set of build tasks to run. The following example shows the default configuration for `type` and `build` from `magento-cloud/.magento.app.yaml`:

```yaml
# The toolstack used to build the application.
type: php:8.1
build:
    flavor: none

dependencies:
    php:
        composer/composer: '2.2.4'
```

### Installing and using Composer 2

The `build: flavor:` property is not used for Composer 2.x; therefore, you must manually install Composer during the build phase. To install and use Composer 2.x in your Starter and Pro projects, you need to make three changes to your `.magento.app.yaml` configuration:

1. Remove `composer` as the `build: flavor:` and add `none`. This change prevents Cloud from using the default 1.x version of Composer to run build tasks.
1. Add `composer/composer: '^2.0'` as a `php` dependency to install Composer 2.x.
1. Add the `composer` build tasks to a `build` hook to run the build tasks using Composer 2.x.

Use the following configuration fragments in your own `.magento.app.yaml` configuration:

```yaml
# 1. Change flavor to none.
build:
    flavor: none

# 2. Add composer ^2.0 as a php dependency.
dependencies:
    php:
        composer/composer: '^2.0'

# 3. Add a build hook to run the build tasks using Composer 2.x.
hooks:
    build: |
        set -e
        composer --no-ansi --no-interaction install --no-progress --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
```

{:.bs-callout-warning}
The `.magento.app.yaml` file is deployed to all environments. This `composer` command installs all `dev` dependencies. Use caution and modify your code as needed for Production environments.

## `access`

The `access` property indicates a minimum user role level that is allowed SSH access to the environments. The available user roles are:

-  `admin`—Can change settings and execute actions in the environment. Also has _contributor_ and _viewer_ rights.
-  `contributor`—Can push code to this environment and branch from the environment. Also has _viewer_ rights.
-  `viewer`—Can view the environment only.

The default user role is `contributor`, which restricts the SSH access from users with only _viewer_ rights. You can change the user role to `viewer` to allow SSH access for users with only _viewer_ rights:

```yaml
access:
    ssh: viewer
```

## `relationships`

Defines the service mapping in the application.

The relationship `name` is available to the application in the `MAGENTO_CLOUD_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable. The `<service-name>:<endpoint-name>` relationship maps to the name and type values defined in the `.magento/services.yaml` file.

```yaml
relationships:
    <name>: "<service-name>:<endpoint-name>"
```

The following is an example of the default relationships:

```yaml
relationships:
    database: "mysql:mysql"
    redis: "redis:redis"
    opensearch: "opensearch:opensearch"
    rabbitmq: "rabbitmq:rabbitmq"
```

See [Services]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/services.html) for a full list of currently supported service types and endpoints.

## `web`

The `web` property defines how your application is exposed to the web (in HTTP), determines how the web application serves content, and controls how the application container responds to incoming requests by setting rules in each location _block_. A block represents an absolute path leading with a forward slash (`/`).

```yaml
web:
    locations:
        "/":
            # The public directory of the app, relative to its root.
```

You can fine-tune your `locations` configuration using the following key values for each `locations` block:

| Attribute  | Description |
| - | - |
| `allow` | Serve files that do not match "rules". Default value = `true` |
| `expires` | Set the number of seconds to cache content in the browser. This key enables the `cache-control` and `expires` headers for static content. If this value is not set, the `expires` directive and resulting headers are not included when serving static content files. A negative 1 (`-1`) value results in no caching and is the default value. You can express time value with the following units:  `ms` (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days), `w` (weeks), `M` (months, 30d), or `y` (years, 365d) |
| `headers` | Set custom headers, such as `X-Frame-Options`, for static content served from this location. |
| `index` | List the static files to serve your application, such as the `index.html` file. This key expects a collection. This only works if access to the file or files is "allowed" by the `allow` or `rules` key for this location. |
| `rules` | Specify overrides for a location. Use a regular expression to match a request. If an incoming request matches the rule, then regular handling of the request is overridden by the keys used in the rule. |
| `passthru` | Set the URL used in the event that a static file or PHP file cannot be found. Typically, this URL is the front controller for your applications, such as `/index.php` or `/app.php`. |
| `root` | Set the path relative to the root of the application that is exposed on the web. The public directory (location "/") for a Cloud project is set to "pub" by default. |
| `scripts` | Allow loading scripts in this location. Set the value to `true` to allow scripts. |

Our default configuration allows the following:

-  From the root (`/`) path, only web and media can be accessed
-  From the `~/pub/static` and `~/pub/media` paths, any file can be accessed

The following example shows the default configuration for a set of web-accessible locations associated with an entry in the  [`mounts` property](#mounts):

```yaml
 # The configuration of app when it is exposed to the web.
web:
    locations:
        "/":
            # The public directory of the app, relative to its root.
            root: "pub"
            # The front-controller script to send non-static requests to.
            passthru: "/index.php"
            index:
                - index.php
            expires: -1
            scripts: true
            allow: false
            rules:
                \.(css|js|map|hbs|gif|jpe?g|png|tiff|wbmp|ico|jng|bmp|svgz|midi?|mp?ga|mp2|mp3|m4a|ra|weba|3gpp?|mp4|mpe?g|mpe|ogv|mov|webm|flv|mng|asx|asf|wmv|avi|ogx|swf|jar|ttf|eot|woff|otf|html?)$:
                    allow: true
                ^/sitemap(.*)\.xml$:
                    passthru: "/media/sitemap$1.xml"
        "/media":
            root: "pub/media"
            allow: true
            scripts: false
            expires: 1y
            passthru: "/get.php"
        "/static":
            root: "pub/static"
            allow: true
            scripts: false
            expires: 1y
            passthru: "/front-static.php"
            rules:
                ^/static/version\d+/(?<resource>.*)$:
                    passthru: "/static/$resource"

```

{:.bs-callout-info}
This example shows the default web configuration for a Cloud project configured to support a single domain. For a project that requires support for multiple websites or stores, the `web` configuration must be set up to support shared domains. See [Configure locations for shared domains]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/project-multi-sites.html#locations).

## `disk`

Defines the persistent disk size of the application in MB.

```yaml
disk: 5120
```

The minimal recommended disk size is 256MB. If you see the error `UserError: Error building the project: Disk size may not be smaller than 128MB`, increase the size to 256MB.

## `mounts`

An object whose keys are paths relative to the root of the application. The mount is a writable area on the disk for files. The following is a default list of mounts configured in the `magento.app.yaml` file using the `volume_id[/subpath]` syntax:

```yaml
 # The mounts that will be performed when the package is deployed.
mounts:
    "var": "shared:files/var"
    "app/etc": "shared:files/etc"
    "pub/media": "shared:files/media"
    "pub/static": "shared:files/static"
```

The format for adding your mount to this list is as follows:

```bash
"/public/sites/default/files": "shared:files/files"
```

-  `shared`—Shares a volume between your applications inside an environment.
-  `disk`—Defines the size available for the shared volume.

You can make the mount web accessible by adding it to the [`web`](#web) block of locations.

{:.bs-callout-warning}
Once your site has data, do not change the `subpath` portion of the mount name. This value is the unique identifier for the files area. If you change this name, you will lose all site data stored at the old location.

## `dependencies`

Enables you to specify dependencies that your application might need during the build process.

{{site.data.var.ee}} supports dependencies on the following languages:

-  PHP
-  Ruby
-  Node.js

Those dependencies are independent of the eventual dependencies of your application, and are available in the `PATH`, during the build process and in the runtime environment of your application.

You can specify those dependencies as follows:

```yaml
ruby:
   sass: "~3.4"
nodejs:
   grunt-cli: "~0.3"
```

## `hooks`

Use the `hooks` section to run shell commands during the build, deploy, and post-deploy phases:

-  **`build`**—Execute commands _before_ packaging your application. Services, such as the database or Redis, are not available at this time since the application has not been deployed yet. You must add custom commands _before_ the default `php ./vendor/bin/ece-tools` command so that custom-generated content continues to the deployment phase.

-  **`deploy`**—Execute commands _after_ packaging and deploying your application. You can access other services at this point. Since the default `php ./vendor/bin/ece-tools` command copies the `app/etc` directory to the correct location, you must add custom commands _after_ the deploy command to prevent custom commands from failing.

-  **`post_deploy`**—Execute commands _after_ deploying your application and _after_ the container begins accepting connections. The `post_deploy` hook clears the cache and preloads (warms) the cache. You can customize the list of pages using the `WARM_UP_PAGES` variable in the [Post-deploy stage]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/env/variables-post-deploy.html). Although not required, this works in tandem with the `SCD_ON_DEMAND` environment variable.

Add CLI commands under the `build`, `deploy`, or `post_deploy` sections _before_ the `ece-tools` command:

```yaml
hooks:
    # We run build hooks before your application has been packaged.
    build: |
        set -e
        composer install
        php ./vendor/bin/ece-tools run scenario/build/generate.xml
        php ./vendor/bin/ece-tools run scenario/build/transfer.xml
    # We run deploy hook after your application has been deployed and started.
    deploy: |
        php ./vendor/bin/ece-tools run scenario/deploy.xml
    # We run post deploy hook to clean and warm the cache. Available with ECE-Tools 2002.0.10.
    post_deploy: |
        php ./vendor/bin/ece-tools run scenario/post-deploy.xml
```

Also, you can customize the build phase further by using the `generate` and `transfer` commands to perform additional actions when specifically building code or moving files.

```yaml
hooks:
    # We run build hooks before your application has been packaged.
    build: |
        set -e
        php ./vendor/bin/ece-tools build:generate
        # php /path/to/your/script
        php ./vendor/bin/ece-tools build:transfer
```

-  `set -e`—causes hooks to fail on the first failed command, instead of the final failed command.
-  `build:generate`—applies patches, validates configuration, generates DI, and generates static content if SCD is enabled for build phase.
-  `build:transfer`—transfers generated code and static content to the final destination.

The commands run from the application (`/app`) directory. You can use the `cd` command to change the directory. The hooks fail if the final command in them fails. To cause them to fail on the first failed command, add `set -e` to the beginning of the hook.

{:.procedure}
To compile Sass files using grunt:

```yaml
dependencies:
    ruby:
        sass: "3.4.7"
    nodejs:
        grunt-cli: "~0.1.13"

hooks:
    build: |
        cd public/profiles/project_name/themes/custom/theme_name
        npm install
        grunt
        cd
        php ./vendor/bin/ece-tools build
```

You must compile Sass files using `grunt` before static content deployment, which happens during the build. Place the `grunt` command before the `build` command.

{% include cloud/note-ece-tools-custom-deployment.md %}

## `crons`

Describes processes that are triggered on a schedule. We recommend you run `cron` as the [file system owner]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/before/before-workspace-file-sys-owner.html). Do _not_ run cron as `root` or as the web server user.

`crons` support the following:

-  `spec`—The cron specification. For Starter environments and Pro Integration environments, the minimum interval is once per five minutes and once per one minute in Pro Staging and Production environments. You need to complete [additional configurations]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/configure/setup-cron-jobs.html#add-cron) for crons in those environments.
-  `cmd`—The command to execute.

A cron job is well suited for the following tasks:

-  They need to happen on a fixed schedule, not continually.
-  The task itself is not especially long, as a running cron job will block a new deployment.
-  Or it is long, but can be easily divided into many small queued tasks.
-  A delay between when a task is registered and when it actually happens is acceptable.

By default, every Cloud project has the following default crons configuration to run the default cron jobs:

```yaml
crons:
    cronrun:
        spec: "* * * * *"
        cmd: "php bin/magento cron:run"
```

For {{site.data.var.ece}} 2.1.x, you can use only [workers]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/project/magento-app-workers.html) and [cron jobs](#crons). For {{site.data.var.ece}} 2.2.x, cron jobs launch consumers to process batches of messages, and do not require additional configuration.

If your project requires custom cron jobs, you can add them to the default cron configuration. See [Set up cron jobs]({{ site.baseurl }}/cloud/configure/setup-cron-jobs.html).

## `firewall` (Starter plans only)

For Starter plans, the `firewall` property adds an _outbound_ firewall to the application. This firewall has no affect on incoming requests. It defines which `tcp` outbound requests can _leave_ a {{site.data.var.ee}} site. This is called egress filtering. The outbound firewall is filtering what can egress—exit or escape—your site. And when you limit what can escape, you add a powerful security tool to your server.

### Default restriction policies

The firewall provides two default policies to control outbound traffic: `allow` and `deny`. The `allow` policy _allows_ all outbound traffic by default. And the `deny` policy _denies_ all outbound traffic by default. But as soon as you add a rule, the default policy is overridden, and the firewall blocks **all** outbound traffic not allowed by the rule.

For Starter plans, we set the default policy to `allow`. This setting ensures that all your current outbound traffic remains unblocked until you add your egress filtering rules. We can also set the default policy to `deny` upon request.

**To check your default policy**:

```bash
magento-cloud p:curl --project PROJECT_ID /settings | grep -i outbound
```

Unless you requested `deny` for your policy, the command should show your policy set to `allow`:

```terminal
"outbound_restrictions_default_policy": "allow"
```

{:.bs-callout-info}
**Key takeaway**: When you add an outbound rule, you block all outbound traffic except for the domains, IP addresses, or ports you add to the rule. So it is important to have a full outbound list defined and tested before adding it to your production site.

### `firewall` configurations

The following example shows all the `firewall` options you can use to add rules for your egress filtering.

```yaml
firewall:
    outbound:
        - # Common accessed domains
            domains:

            ports:
                - 80
                - 443
```

### Egress filtering rules

Outbound firewall configurations are made up of rules. You can define as many rules as you need. The requirements for rules are as follows.

**Each rule:**

-  Must start with a hyphen (`-`). Adding a comment on the same line helps document and visually separate one rule from the next.
-  Must define at least one of the following options: `domains`, `ips`, or `ports`.
-  Must use the `tcp` protocol. Because this is the default protocol for all rules, you can omit it from the rule.
-  Can define `domains` or `ips`, but not both in the same rule.
-  Can include `yaml` comments (`#`) and line breaks to organize the domains, IP addresses, and ports allowed.

### `protocol`

As mentioned, TCP is the default and only protocol allowed for rules. UDP and its ports are not allowed. For this reason, you can omit the `protocol` option from all rules. If you want to include it anyway, you must set the value to `tcp`, as shown in the first rule of the example.

### `domains`

The `domains` option allows a list of [fully qualified domain names (FQDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name).

If a rule defines `domains` but not `ports`, the firewall allows domain requests on any port.

### `ips`

The `ips` option allows a list of IP addresses in the [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing). You can specify single IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses.

To specify a single IP address, add the `/32` CIDR prefix to the end of your IP address:

```terminal
172.217.11.174/32  # google.com
```

To specify a range of IP addresses, use the [IP Range to CIDR](https://ipaddressguide.com/cidr) calculator.

If a rule defines `ips` but not `ports`, the firewall allows IP requests on any port.

### `ports`

The `ports` option allows a list of ports from 1 to 65535. For most rules in the example, we added ports `80` and `443` to allow both HTTP and HTTPS requests. But for New Relic, we created rules that only allow access to domains and IP addresses on port `443`, [as recommended](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/networks#agents).

If a rule only defines `ports`, the firewall allows access to all domains and IP addresses for the ports defined.

{:.bs-callout-info}
Port `25`, the SMTP port to send email, is always blocked, without exception.

### Finding domain names to allow

To help you identify the domains to include in your egress filtering rules, use the following command to parse your server's `dns.log` file and show a list of all the DNS requests your site has logged:

```shell
awk '($5 ~/query/)' /var/log/dns.log | awk '{print $6}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

This command also shows DNS requests that were made but blocked by your egress filtering rules. The output does not show which domains were blocked, only that requests were made. The output does not show any requests made using an IP address.

```terminal
Example output:

97 magento.com
93 magentocommerce.com
88 google.com
70 metadata.google.internal.0
70 metadata.google.internal
65 newrelic.com
56 fastly.com
17 mcprod-0vunku5xn24ip.ap-4.magentosite.cloud
6 advancedreporting.rjmetrics.com
```

Domains, in contrast to IP addresses, are typically more specific and secure for egress filtering. For example, if you add an IP address for a service that uses a CDN, you are allowing the IP address for the CDN, which can be used by hundreds or thousands of other domains. With one IP address, you could be allowing outbound access to thousands of other servers.

### Testing egress filtering rules

After collecting and configuring access rules for the domains and IP addresses your site needs, it is time to push and test.

The following workflow describes a simple way to test your egress filtering rules:

1. Create a shell script of `curl` commands to access the domains and IP addresses in your rules. You should include commands that test access to domains and IPs that should be blocked.

1. Configure a `post_deploy` hook in your `.magento.app.yaml` file to run the script.

1. Push your `firewall` configuration and your test script to your integration branch.

1. Examine the `post_deploy` output from your `curl` commands.
