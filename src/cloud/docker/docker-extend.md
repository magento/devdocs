## Specify multiple compose files

You can use the built-in extension mechanism of Docker to specify [multiple compose files]. The following example replaces the default value of the `ENABLE_SENDMAIL` environment variable.

1. Create a `docker-compose-dev.yml` file inside your project root directory and add the following content:

   ```yaml
   version: '2'
   services:
     deploy:
       environment:
         - ENABLE_SENDMAIL=true
   ```

1. Pass both configuration files while executing your commands. For example:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-dev.yml run deploy bash
   ```

## Specify Docker build sources
To locally test changes to images or make more extensive changes to the containers, you must build them from source.

The following example shows how to build from source by adding `build:context` configuration  to the `docker-compose.override.yml` file. This example defines the build context for the web container. You can use the same technique to build from any of the images in `vendor/magento/magento-cloud-docker` or any other Docker image, including images locally resourced outside the project.

```yaml
version: '2.1'
services:
 web:
   build:
     context: ./vendor/magento/magento-cloud-docker/images/nginx/1.9/
```

If you want to update the container configuration and test iteratively, run the following command to refresh the container build.

```bash
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --build
```
