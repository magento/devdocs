In a Docker development environment, the {{site.data.var.ee}} application works only if the Docker containers have access to the {{site.data.var.ee}} application data. You can provide access either by directly mapping the current working directory or by using a file synchronization tool.

The {{site.data.var.mcd}}  `docker-build` command provides the `--sync-engine <type>` option to select the file synchronization behavior when you build the `docker-compose.yml` configuration file. You can select from the following values:

`--sync-engine` value | Description
--------------------- | ------------
`native` | Maps the current working directory to the `/app` directory on each volume, which provides direct access to the data without requiring any synchronization. The `native` option is the default and works for Linux hosts. On macOS or Windows hosts, this option results in extremely slow performance in the Docker environment.
`mutagen` | Uses [Mutagen] for file synchronization. When you select Mutagen, you must [install Mutagen] on your host operating system before you [launch Docker in developer mode]. Use this option on macOS or Windows hosts.
`docker-sync` | Uses [docker-sync] for file synchronization. When you select docker-sync, you must [install docker-sync] on your host operating system before you [launch Docker in developer mode]. Use this option on macOS or Windows hosts.

When you start Docker with the native file synchronization option, the current working directory maps to the `/app` folder in the containers:

```yaml
  fpm:
    volumes:
      - '.:/app'
  build:
    volumes:
      - '.:/app'
  deploy:
    volumes:
      - '.:/app'
  web:
    volumes:
      - '.:/app'
  cron:
    volumes:
      - '.:/app'
```

## Configure file synchronization

You do not have to configure file synchronization if you use the `native` option since this is the default setting.

On macOS or Windows systems, you can configure file synchronization using Mutagen or docker-sync by adding the `--sync-engine="<type>"` option to the `docker:build` command.

For example:

```bash
./vendor/bin/ece-docker build:compose --mode="developer" --sync-engine="mutagen"
```
