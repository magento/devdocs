The [Magento Cloud Patches](https://github.com/magento/magento-cloud-patches) package provides a set of patches which improve the integration of all Magento versions with Cloud environments and supports quick delivery of critical fixes.

The {{ site.data.var.mcp }} package is a dependency for the {{site.data.var.ct}} package and is installed and updated when you install or update the {{ site.data.var.ct }} package. You can also use and manage the {{ site.data.var.mcp }} as a stand-alone package to apply patches to a {{ site.data.var.ee }} project that is not on the Cloud platform. These release notes describe the latest improvements to this package.


The `{{site.data.var.mcp}}` package uses the following version sequence: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.

## v1.0.0

This is the first release of the [`magento/magento-cloud-patches`](https://github.com/magento/magento-cloud-patches) package, which is a new dependency for the `{{ site.data.var.ct }}` package version 2002.0.22 or later releases.
