The [Magento Cloud Patches](https://github.com/magento/magento-cloud-patches) package provides a set of required patches which improve the integration of all {{site.data.var.ee}} versions with Cloud environments and supports quick delivery of critical fixes.

The {{ site.data.var.mcp }} package is a dependency for the {{site.data.var.ct}} package and is installed and updated when you install or update the {{ site.data.var.ct }} package. You can also use and manage {{ site.data.var.mcp-prod }} as a stand-alone package to apply patches to a {{ site.data.var.ee }} project that is not on the Cloud platform. These release notes describe the latest improvements to this package.

{:.bs-callout-tip}
To ensure that your project has all required patches, update to the [latest version of {{ site.data.var.ct }}]({{site.baseurl}}/cloud/project/ece-tools-update.html).

{:.bs-callout-info}
See [Apply patches]({{site.baseurl}}/cloud/project/project-patch.html) for instructions on applying patches to your projects.

The `{{site.data.var.mcp-package}}` package uses the following version sequence: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

## v1.0.1

Release date: February 6, 2020

We have included all {{site.data.var.ce}} 2.x patches from the [software downloads page](https://magento.com/tech-resources/download) in the {{site.data.var.mcp-package}} v1.0.1 release. If you copied any patches into your project previously, remove them to avoid conflicts.

This release includes the following patches and critical fixes:

-  **Fix cron deadlocks and improve cron locking**—

   -  Fixes an issue with some cron jobs not running due to an incorrect status value in the `cron_schedule` table. Now, we use the {{site.data.var.ee}} lock framework to check and update cron job status instead of using the `cron_schedule` table. Cron jobs that have ended with an error status are retried during the next cron run instead of waiting 24 hours.

   -  Adds a _retry_ operation to avoid deadlock during updates to the data in the `cron_schedule` table.

-  **Updated `{{site.data.var.mcp-package}}` to include all available patches for {{site.data.var.ce}} 2.x**—Updated the {{site.data.var.mcp-package}} package to include all {{site.data.var.ce}} 2.x patches available on the [software downloads page](https://magento.com/tech-resources/download). If you copied any {{site.data.var.ce}} patches into your {{site.data.var.ece}} project previously, remove them to avoid conflicts.<!--MAGECLOUD-4606-->

-  **Elasticsearch catalog pagination fix** —Replaced the Elasticsearch catalog pagination patch delivered in {{site.data.var.mcp-package}} v1.0 with a more effective fix.<!--MAGECLOUD-4847-->

-  **Page Builder patches**—In {{site.data.var.mcp-prod}} 1.0.0, we bundled Page Builder patches to address a known Page Builder remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, with the initial fix based on {{site.data.var.ee}} 2.3.3. We have updated these patches with a more stable implementation based on {{site.data.var.ee}} 2.3.4., which includes multiple optimizations for fixing the issue.<!--MAGECLOUD-4884-->

   If you have the {{site.data.var.mcp-package}} 1.0.0 package, you are still protected from the Page Builder RCE vulnerability issues. If you update to 1.0.1 or later, you have a better implementation of the same fix.

## v1.0.0

Release date: November 14, 2019

This is the first release of the [`magento/magento-cloud-patches`](https://github.com/magento/magento-cloud-patches) package, which is a new dependency for the `{{ site.data.var.ct }}` package version 2002.0.22 or later releases.

This release includes the following patches and critical fixes:

-  **Page Builder security patches for 2.3.1.x and 2.3.2.x releases**—Fixes an issue in Page Builder preview that allows unauthenticated users to access some templating methods that can be used to trigger arbitrary code execution over the network (RCE) resulting in global information leaks. This issue can occur when using unsupported versions of Page Builder with {{ site.data.var.ee }} versions 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.<!--MAGECLOUD-4649-->

-  **Catalog pagination does not work on Elasticsearch 6.x**—Fixes a critical issue with search result pagination that affects customers using Elasticsearch 6.x as the catalog search engine.<!--MAGECLOUD-4448-->
