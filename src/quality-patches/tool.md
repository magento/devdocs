The [Quality Patches Tool][github] is a command-line tool that delivers
quality patches for {{site.data.var.ee}} and {{site.data.var.ce}}.

It allows you to:

*  View general information about the latest quality patches
*  Apply quality patches
*  Revert applied patches

**{{site.data.var.ee}} support** and the **{{site.data.var.ce}} community** develop quality patches.

The Quality Patches Tool is for quality patches only. Security patches are available in the [Magento Security Center][security] .

{:.bs-callout-warning}
We do not recommend using the Quality Patches Tool to apply large numbers of patches, because it increases the complexity of your code, which makes upgrading to a new version of {{ site.data.var.ee }} or {{ site.data.var.ce }} more difficult.
