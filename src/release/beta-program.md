title: Adobe Commerce Beta program

Welcome to the Adobe Beta Program and thank you for your interest in participating.
This program is available to all our partners.
To sign up for the Beta program, you must be a current [Solution Partner][] or Technology Partner with Adobe.
Read and follow the steps outlined below to participate in the program.

## Why participate

1. The earlier you see the code we are developing the sooner you can prepare your technology and merchants for the upcoming upgrade.
   Yes, things may change, but you will get an understanding where in the codebase changes are happening and start your preparations sooner than the General Availability release date.
1. Provide valuable feedback to Adobe developers and help us find and correct issues sooner.

Ready to participate? Follow the steps below.

## Sign the NDA

First, we need your company to sign our [Beta Agreement][].
To verify the authenticity of the signature, we ask you to have the Adobe relationship owner, typically the owner of the _primary_ MageID associated with your company, read and sign the document linked above.
​
Further instructions while filling out the form:

-  Make sure to use the email associated with the primary MageID.
-  For _Adobe Contact Email_, use `magebeta@adobe.com` - _We may not receive your request if you do not use this email!_.

## Developer access to GitHub

Second, to provide feedback and receive important updates about the Beta, we must grant users access to our private GitHub repository.

If you are already in the Adobe Partner Program, we will give the GitHub users access to our private repository after the Beta Program Agreement is signed.
No need to do anything else.
​
If you are not already in the Adobe Partner Program, you must do the following:

1. Make sure all of your contributors have an active GitHub account with two-factor authentication enabled.
1. Provide a maintainer GitHub username. We will provide that user the ability to add additional users associated with the parent company who signed the Beta Program Agreement (`github.com/accountname`).
1. Contact <magebeta@adobe.com> from the official partner’s company email with the maintainer and ask to join.

## Get the Code

Third, the pre-production code will be released as a Composer metapackage on <https://repo.magento.com>.
The date of this Beta release will be announced on our private GitHub repository.
Visit this page six weeks ahead of our set [release calendar][] for the latest information about our upcoming Beta release.
