## Compatibility

Adobe Commerce modules that have been built to be decoupled from the {{site.data.var.ee}} core release process; this allows us to release iterations of these modules faster to merchants who are willing to accept a little risk in exchange for earlier access to new features.

The following table shows the release status of extension versions relative to {{site.data.var.ee}}.
