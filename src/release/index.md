Magento continually strives to find the right balance between making product upgrades simple and predictable and delivering improvements and new features to early adopters faster. Over the last year, we have refined how we deliver software to support this balance. For additional information, refer to our [release policy]({{site.baseurl}}/release/policy/).

## Release schedule

Magento releases security and functional patches for each supported release line of {{site.data.var.ee}} every quarter.

We have introduced a [new policy](https://magento.com/updated-lifecycle-policy-magento-releases) that applies to a previous, supported Magento release line.

## Early access

Pre-release is General Availability code that is available to {{site.data.var.ee}} merchants and all partners two weeks before General Availability. It allows for quicker deployment of code before General Availability.

Beta is non-General Availability code that is available to all partners. It allows for extra time to review code and affected components.
