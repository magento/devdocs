content: "The **Release Notification Module** serves to provide a notification delivery
  platform for displaying new features of a Magento installation or upgrade as well
  as any other required release notifications.\n\n## Purpose and Content\n\n* Provides
  a method of notifying administrators of changes, features, and functionality being
  introduced in a Magento release.\n* Displays a modal containing a high level overview
  of the features included in the installed or upgraded release of Magento upon the
  initial login of each administrator into the Admin Panel for a given Magento version.\n*
  The modal is enabled with pagination functionality to allow for easy navigation
  between each modal page.\n* Each modal page includes detailed information about
  a highlighted feature of the Magento release or other notification.\n* Release Notification
  modal content is determined and provided by Magento Marketing.\n\n## Content Retrieval\n\nRelease
  notification content is maintained by Magento for each Magento version, edition,
  and locale. To retrieve the content, a response is returned from a request with
  the following parameters:\n\n*  **version** = The Magento version that the client
  has installed (ex. 2.3.0).\n*  **edition** = The Magento edition that the client
  has installed (ex. Community).\n*  **locale** = The chosen locale of the admin user
  (ex. en_US).\n\nThe module will make three attempts to retrieve content for the
  parameters in the order listed:\n\n1. Version/Edition/Locale\n2. Version/Edition/en_US
  (default locale)\n3. Version (default file for a Magento version)\n\nIf there is
  no content to be retrieved after these requests, the release notification modal
  will not be displayed to the admin user.\n\n## Content Guidelines\n\nThe modal system
  in the ReleaseNotification module can have up to four modal pages. The admin user
  can navigate between pages using the \"< Prev\" and \"Next >\" buttons at the bottom
  of the modal. The last modal page will have a \"Done\" button that will close the
  modal and record that the admin user has seen the notification. \n\nEach modal page
  can have the following optional content:\n\n* Main Content\n    * Title\n    * URL
  to the image to be displayed alongside the title\n    * Text body\n    * Bullet
  point list\n* Sub Headings (highlighted overviews of the content to be detailed
  on subsequent modal pages) - one to three Sub Headings may be displayed\n    * Sub
  heading title\n    * URL to the image to be display before the sub heading title\n
  \   * Sub heading content\n* Footer\n    * Footer content text\n\nThe Sub Heading
  section is ideally used on the first modal page as a way to describe one to three
  highlighted features that will be presented in greater detail on the following modal
  pages. It is recommended to use the Main Content -> Text Body and Bullet Point lists
  as the paragraph and list content displayed on a highlighted feature's detail modal
  page.\n\nA clickable link to internal or external content in any text field will
  be created by using the following format and opened in a new browser tab. Providing
  the URL for the link followed by the text to be displayed for that link in brackets
  will cause a clickable link to be created. The text between the brackets [text]
  will be the text that the clickable link shows.\n\n### Link Format Example:\n\nThe
  text: `https://devdocs.magento.com/ [Magento DevDocs].` will appear as [Magento
  DevDocs](https://devdocs.magento.com/)."
