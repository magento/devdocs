content: "## Overview\n\nThe Magento_Company module allows a merchant to create a
  company account and assign multiple members of the company to the account. \n\nThe
  module also implements roles and permissions for the company members. The company
  admin builds a hierarchical company structure (which consists of teams and users)
  in the storefront and assigns roles and permissions to the company members. This
  hierarchy allows the company admin to control user activity within the account.
  This hierarchy as well as roles and permissions are currently available in the storefront
  only. A merchant can only view the list of company members in Admin.\nA merchant
  can view and manage company profiles in Admin. A company's status controls what
  kind of access the company members have to the website. An admin user can also configure
  company-level emails and allow or disallow a company registration from the storefront.
  Also, this module adds a 'customer type' attribute to the customer in Admin: individual
  user, company member or company admin.\n\n## Installation details\n \nThis module
  does not create any backward incompatible changes. This module can be deactivated
  after all the other B2B modules (except QuickOrder and RequisitionList) are deactivated.\n
