content: "## Overview\n\nThe Magento_SharedCatalog modules defines the visibility
  of products as well as product prices in the catalog and in B2B quotes for different
  company accounts. \n\nThe module allows a merchant to create multiple shared catalogs,
  link them to one or more company accounts, and set different product prices. Shared
  catalogs also control the visibility of products and categories for a company in
  the storefront. The shared catalog type (public or custom) defines the scope of
  products and prices available for guest users vs logged-in users. The system can
  have only one public and any number of custom shared catalogs.\n\nThe module relies
  on the CatalogPermissions module, in that the visibility of categories for a customer
  group is defined by category permissions for this customer group. Once a shared
  catalog is enabled in B2B features, the category permissions are automatically enabled.
  Adding a product or a category to a shared catalog enables appropriate category
  permissions for the customer groups linked to this shared catalog.\n\nThe module
  provides web APIs and can be integrated with third-party solutions to manage shared
  catalogs in Magento.\n \n## Installation details\n \nThe module heavily depends
  on the Magento_Company module, which must be installed and enabled the first. Category
  permissions must be enabled for shared catalogs to work properly. Price configuration
  for a shared catalog requires the start of a message queue consumer `sharedCatalogUpdatePrice`.\n\nThe
  module does not create any backward incompatible changes. Can be deactivated and
  uninstalled at any time.\n\nWhen the module is uninstalled, the other [ProductType]SharedCatalog
  modules won't work.\n \n## Structure\n \n[Learn about a typical file structure for
  a Magento 2 module](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/extension-dev-guide/build/module-file-structure.html).\n
