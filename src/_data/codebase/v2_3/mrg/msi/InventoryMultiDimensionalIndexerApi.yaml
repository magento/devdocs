  the MSI (Multi-Source Inventory) project in more detail.\n\n## Installation details\n\nThis
  module is installed as part of Magento Open Source. It cannot be deleted or disabled.\n\n\n##
  Extension points\n\nThe library introduces a set of extension points which split
  a monolithic index by the specified dimension (Scope), creating \nan independent
  index (i.e. dedicated MySQL table) per dimension. The library also provides a mechanism
  for resolving \nindex names based on the provided scope. The multi-dimension indexes
  are introduced for the sake of data scalability\nand the ability to reindex data
  in the scope of particular dimension only.\n\nAn aliasing mechanism guarantees zero
  downtime to make Front-End responsive while Full Reindex being processed.\n"
