  describes the MSI (Multi-Source Inventory) project in more detail.

  ## Installation details

  This module is installed as part of Magento Open Source. It cannot be deleted or disabled.

  ## Extensibility

  The `InventorySourceSelectionApi` module contains extension points and APIs that 3rd-party developers
  can use to provide custom inventory source selection algorithm functionality.

  ### Public APIs

  Public APIs are defined in the `Api` and `Api/Data` directories.

  ### REST endpoints

  The `etc/webapi.xml` file defines endpoints for setting the SSA and retrieving a list of valid SSAs.
