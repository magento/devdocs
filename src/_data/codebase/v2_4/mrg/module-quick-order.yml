  The Magento_QuickOrder module allows customers to improve their user experience by creating a new order from a list of multiple SKUs.

  Multiple items can be sent to the shopping cart from a CSV file, by copy-pasting multiple SKUs from another source, or by manually entering SKUs one-by-one into the Quick Order form. This feature is available for both logged-in users and guests.

  ## Installation details

  The module does not create any backward incompatible changes. It heavily depends on the Magento_AdvancedCheckout module and cannot work without it. Can be deactivated and uninstalled at any time.
