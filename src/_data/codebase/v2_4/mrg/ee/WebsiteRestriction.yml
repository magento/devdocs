  **Website Restriction** enables administrators to restrict all access to the site or restrict site access
  to only logged in customers. You might want to restrict all access when the site is closed for maintenance.
  You might want to restrict site access to only logged in customers if the site is a B2B site or if there is
  a private sale for registered customers.
