  Magento\Reward module allows an online merchant to implement unique programs designed to enhance user experience and increase
  customer loyalty. Points are awarded based on a wide range of transaction and customer activities, with the ability for
  the merchant to control point allotment, balance, and expiration. Customers can redeem points toward purchases based on
  a conversion rate between points and currency that is set up by the merchant.
