content: "The `Inventory` module is part of the new inventory infrastructure,\nwhich
  replaces the legacy `CatalogInventory` module with new and expanded features and
  APIs for Inventory Management.  \n \nThe [Inventory Management overview](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/inventory/index.html)\ndescribes
  the MSI (Multi-Source Inventory) project in more detail.\n\nAll Inventory Management
  modules follow the \n[Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle).\n[Inventory
  management architecture](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/inventory/architecture.html)
  \nprovides additional insight about the overall structure of these modules.\n\n##
  Installation details\n\nThis module is installed as part of Magento Open Source.
  Unless a custom implementation for `InventoryApi` is provided\nby a 3rd-party module,
  the module cannot be deleted or disabled.\n\n## Extension points and service contracts\n\nMagento
  does not recommend using or referring to classes and other entities in the `Inventory`
  module. All public \ninterfaces and extension points related to this module are
  located in the `InventoryApi` module. \nUse the interfaces and extension points
  defined in `InventoryApi` to extend this module."
