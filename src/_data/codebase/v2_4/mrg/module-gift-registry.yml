  Magento\GiftRegistry module that allows to create sets of gifts specified for specific holiday(Birthday, Wedding, etc).
  It resembles wishlist, but there are differences. You can describe Gift Registry as a wishlist of products you would
  like to share with other people so they could purchase anything from the list. Customer can even set some shipping
  address to a gift registry, thus anyone who follows this list with a purchase would automatically have that shipping
  address set by default during checkout. Customer can manage his gift registries in his profile. The gift registry can be
  shared or stay private. Every gift registry has system attributes and can have custom attributes.
