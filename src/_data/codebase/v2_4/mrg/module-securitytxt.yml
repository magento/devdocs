title: Securitytxt
content: "### Summary\n>  When security vulnerabilities are discovered by researchers,
  proper reporting channels are often lacking. As a result, vulnerabilities may be
  left unreported. This document defines a format (\"security.txt\") to help organizations
  describe their vulnerability disclosure practices to make it easier for researchers
  to report vulnerabilities.\n\nSource: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-09\n\nThe
  Magento_Securitytxt module provides the following functionality: \n* allows to save
  the security configurations in the admin panel\n* contains a router to match application
  action class for requests to the `.well-known/security.txt` and `.well-known/security.txt.sig`
  files.\n* serves the content of the `.well-known/security.txt` and `.well-known/security.txt.sig`
  files.\n\nA valid security.txt file could look like the following example:\n\n```\nContact:
  mailto:security@example.com\nContact: tel:+1-201-555-0123\nEncryption: https://example.com/pgp.asc\nAcknowledgement:
  https://example.com/security/hall-of-fame\nPolicy: https://example.com/security-policy.html\nSignature:
  https://example.com/.well-known/security.txt.sig\n```\nSecurity.txt can be accessed
  at below location:\n`https://example.com/.well-known/security.txt`\n\nTo create
  security.txt signature (security.txt.sig) file:\n\n`gpg -u KEYID --output security.txt.sig
  --armor --detach-sig security.txt`\n\nTo verify the security.txt file's signature:\n\n`gpg
  --verify security.txt.sig security.txt`"
