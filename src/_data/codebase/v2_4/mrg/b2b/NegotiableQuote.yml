content: "## Overview\n\nThe Magento_NegotiableQuote module allows a customer and
  a merchant (admin user) to negotiate product and/or shipping prices before the customer
  places an order. Its functionality is available for the company members only. \n\nCurrently,
  B2B quoting is global--the price is given for the quote as a whole. Quoting per
  item is not supported. The quote lifecycle is managed via quote statuses. The quoting
  interface allows both a merchant and a customer to manage items in the quote (add,
  delete, change quantity) as well as make an offer (or request a quote) for items
  and/or for shipping. The negotiated price set in the negotiable quote is exactly
  the price that will be applied on a quote during checkout, order generation, and
  invoice generation. \n\nThe module provides a set of configurations for the quoting
  feature, such as the ability to request a quote, configure the minimum quote amount,
  configure the default expiration period, configure attached files, and set email
  templates for quotes. The module provides web APIs and can be integrated with 3rd
  party solutions to manage negotiable quote in Magento.\n \n## Installation details\n
  \nThe module heavily depends on the Quote and Magento_Company modules, which must
  be previously installed and enabled. \n\nAlso, the module has dependency on the
  following Magentoâ€™s B2C modules: Tax module, Checkout module and Cart Pricing Rules
  module. \n\nWhen working with the SharedCatalog module, Negotiable Quote will be
  restricted to the products added to the shared catalog and custom prices set in
  the shared catalog. \n\nThe module does not create any backward incompatible changes.
  Can be deactivated and uninstalled at any time.\n \n## Structure\n \n[Learn about
  a typical file structure for a Magento 2 module](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/extension-dev-guide/build/module-file-structure.html).\n
