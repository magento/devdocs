  The Magento_CustomerSegment module enables customer segmentation, allowing the creation of customer groups based on characteristics like shopping cart content, orders history, address, and so on.
  This allows dynamically targeting different content and promotions for those groups. Various components of a website, such as promotions and banners, can be personalized depending on the customer segment of a customer browsing the store at the moment.
