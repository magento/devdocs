  tool that is the part of Google Analytics functionality.\n\nGoogle Experiment (on
  Google side) allows to make two variants of the same page and compare their popularity.
  \nFrom Magento side, code generated by Google should be saved and displayed on a
  particular page.\nGoogle Experiment functionality is available on pages of products,
  categories and cms pages. \nThis allows to save different codes for products and
  categories on different store views.\nThis functionality can be switched on and
  off on the configuration page (Stores -> Configuration -> General -> Google Api
  -> Google Analytics).\nAlso this functionality depends on Google Analytics module
  and configuration options.\n"
