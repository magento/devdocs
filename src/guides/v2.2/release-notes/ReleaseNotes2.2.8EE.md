title: Magento Commerce 2.2.8 Release Notes

---

*Release notes published on March 26, 2019 and last edited on July 31, 2019.*

We are pleased to present Magento Commerce 2.2.8. This release includes over 30 critical enhancements to product security, over 150 core code fixes and enhancements, and  285 community-submitted pull requests.

Although this release includes these security enhancements, no confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions, so we recommend that you upgrade your Magento software to the latest version as soon as possible.

See [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-2.3.1-2.2.8-and-2.1.17-security-update) for a comprehensive discussion of these issues. All exploitable security issues fixed in this release (2.2.8) have been ported to 2.3.1, 2.1.17, 1.14.4.1, and 1.9.4.1, as appropriate.

## Apply patch PRODSECBUG-2233 to address critical remote code execution vulnerability (RCE)

An unauthenticated cross-site scripting vulnerability combined with an authenticated Phar deserialization vulnerability has left this version of Magento Commerce open to serious exploit. An attacker can use these vulnerabilities to inject JavaScript into the Magento Admin and subsequently launch malicious code in a store user’s browser.   **We strongly recommend that all users of the affected versions of Magento download and apply the appropriate patch as soon as possible**.

This issue and the available patches are discussed in the [Extending the June 25 Security Update to Older Versions of Magento](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Extending-the-June-25-Security-Update-to-Older-Versions-of/ba-p/138231)
blog post. You can directly access patch code through your Magento account for Magento Commerce. Locate the patch by the name. We provide both Git-based and Composer-based patches.

## Apply patch PRODSECBUG-2198 to address critical SQL injection vulnerability

A critical SQL injection vulnerability has been identified in 2.2.x Magento code. A fix for this issue is included in Magento 2.2.8. If you cannot immediately apply the full patch, you can quickly protect your store from this vulnerability by installing patch PRODSECBUG-2198.  However, **we strongly encourage all merchants to stay up-to-date on security patches**. See the description of  PRODSECBUG-2198  in the  [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-2.3.1-2.2.8-and-2.1.17-security-update) for information on this vulnerability.

Follow these steps to download and apply this patch:

1. Access [My Account](https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login).

1. Navigate to the **Downloads** tab. Select the Magento edition and version you need.

1. Select **Support Patches and Security Patches**, then **PRODSECBUG-2198**.

1. Download the patch and upload to a specific directory in your Magento installation such as `m2-hotfixes` (confirm  that the directory is not accessible publicly).

1. From your project root, apply the patch.  `git apply ./m2-hotfixes/<patch-file-name>`.

1. Refresh the cache from the Admin (**System** > **Cache Management**).

## PayPal Payflow Pro active carding activity update

The PayPal Payflow Pro integration in Magento is being actively targeted by carding activity. To resolve these carding activity issues, Magento has provided Composer packages that add an option for Google reCAPTCHA and CAPTCHA to the Payflow Pro checkout form. See [PayPal Payflow Pro active carding activity](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025515991) for a full discussion of this issue and instructions on downloading these packages. **We strongly recommend that all Payflow Pro merchants download and install these packages to help enhance the security of their storefronts**.

## Apply the Admin Dashboard Image-Charts patch to address deprecation of Google Image Charts

Magento 2.x currently uses Google Image Charts to render static charts in Admin dashboards. Google stopped supporting Google Image Charts on March 14, 2019, and Magento is providing the Admin Dashboard Image-Charts  patch to replace Google Image Charts with the Image-Charts free service. Users of Magento 2.x deployments will not be able to view static charts in Magento 2.x instances unless they download and apply this patch.

See  [Switch from deprecated Google Image Charts to Image-Charts for Magento](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024850172) for information on downloading and applying this patch.

## Highlights

Look for the following highlights in this release:

### Merchant tool enhancements

*  **Improved order creation workflow in the Admin**. The Admin order creation workflow has been refactored to eliminate delays when editing billing and shipping addresses. Processing of these fields now happens only after they are populated. <!-- MAGETWO-96174 -->

*  **Ability to upload PDP images without compression and downsizing**. Merchants can now upload PDP images larger than 1920 x 1200  without first compressing and downsizing the images. Previously, when a merchant uploaded a high quality product image (larger than 1920 x 1200), Magento resized and compressed the image. Merchants can now set requirements for resizing and compression as well as compression quality and target width and height. <!-- MAGETWO-95299 -->

### Substantial security enhancements

These releases include security enhancements that help close cross-site scripting, arbitrary code execution, and sensitive data disclosure vulnerabilities as well as other security issues. No confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. All exploitable security issues fixed in this release (2.2.8) have been ported to 2.3.1, 2.1.17, 1.14.4.1, and 1.9.4.1, as appropriate.

### Infrastructure improvements

*  **Magento now supports Elasticsearch 6.x**. (Elasticsearch 5.x  reached end-of-life on March 11, 2019. For more information, see [Elastic Product End of Life Dates](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol). *Fix submitted by community member Romain Ruaud*. Thank you, Romain!

*  Magento’s implementation of the Authorize.Net Direct Post payment method currently uses MD5 based hash for all M1 and M2 installations. As of June 28, 2019, Authorize.Net will stop supporting MD5 based hash usage. See [Authorize.Net Direct Post](https://docs.magento.com/m2/2.2/ee/user_guide/payment/authorize-net-direct-post.html) for a discussion of this deprecation and the steps you need to take to add the new key you’ll need after deprecation.  <!-- MAGETWO-98129-->*

*  The shipping and billing data that a user enters during checkout now persists if the user interrupts checkout to continue shopping. Previously, checkout data was deleted after a cart update. <!-- MAGETWO-95067 -->

### Bundled extension enhancements

This release of Magento includes extensions developed by third-party vendors.

#### dotdigital Engagement Cloud (formerly dotmailer)

*  dotmailer has been rebranded as dotdigital Engagement Cloud.

#### Magento Shipping

*  Multiple improvements to the Shipment workflow user experience.

*  **Batch Processing**. Error messaging and field validation has been added to the batch processing workflow.

*  **Carrier Specific Packaging**. Carrier-specific packaging has been added for FedEx. These packages will be available for selection during shipping if a FedEx carrier is configured.

*  **Security**. We've closed scenarios that could allow for third-party code execution.

*  **Magento Cart Price Rules**. Cart price rules can now be applied to Magento Shipping.

#### Vertex

*  Added support for B2C VAT.

*  Added support for configurable logging.

## Functional fixes

In addition to security enhancements, this release contains the following functional fixes.

### Installation, setup, and deployment

<!-- MC-5926  -->

*  The `bin/magento setup:config:set --enable-syslog-logging=true|false` command now provides the functionality that Magento previously provided in .  See [Logging]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/cli/logging.html).

<!-- MAGETWO-83474  -->

*  The storefront now  uses HTTPS exclusively and the Admin  uses HTTP without resulting in excessive redirects.

<!-- ENGCOM-2958 -->

*  Controllers with different route IDs and front names  no longer redirect users  to the dashboard when a user clicks on a menu link. *Fix submitted by Laura Folco in pull request [18018](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18018)*. [GitHub-7557](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/7557)

<!-- ENGCOM-2723  -->

*  Integrations are no longer reset after running the `bin/magento setup:upgrade` command. *Fix submitted by Pratik Oza in pull request [18273](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18273)*. [GitHub-12095](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12095)

<!-- ENGCOM-3104  -->

*  A new `cron.log` file dedicated to logging cron-related information has been added to Magento. This new log file reduces output previously sent to the `system.log` file, making it easier to find non-cron-related information in the `system.log` file. *Fix submitted by Pieter Hoste in pull request [18389](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18389)*. [GitHub-17190](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17190)

<!-- ENGCOM-3207  -->

<!-- ENGCOM-3881  -->

*  The `config:set --lock-config` command  now acts as expected on all scopes. Previously, after this command was run, admin users were not able to change the configuration for the default store, but could still change it for other scopes. *Fix submitted by Mahesh Singh in pull request [20322](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20322)*. [GitHub-19609](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19609)

### B2B

<!-- MAGETWO-96442  -->

*  Merchants can now add a product to the default public catalog,  and the product can be accessed by the product URL on the storefront. Previously, Magento did not add the product to the shared catalog and instead displayed this error, `Requested categories don't exist`.

<!-- MAGETWO-94884  -->

*  Magento no longer displays a duplicate **Add product** button when you change currency from the Order currency dropdown while creating an order from the Admin.

<!-- MAGETWO-94820  -->

*  Magento no longer deletes custom shared catalogs  when the user that created it is deleted.

<!-- MAGETWO-85125  -->

*  Magento now loads the company profile, roles, and permissions sections of a company account when **Enable Reward Points Functionality** is set to **no** in the Admin, and you flush cache storage.

<!-- MAGETWO-88254  -->

*  Tier pricing remains in effect when you add a product with tier pricing  to an order from the Admin. Previously, Magento converted tier prices to non-discounted product prices when you added more products to the order, applied a custom price to one of the products, or applied a coupon code to the order.

<!-- MAGETWO-90835  -->

*  You can now filter customers by status. Previously, Magento threw an SQL ERROR when you clicked on **Apply Filters** after setting the filter to status.

<!-- MAGETWO-94431  -->

*  Magento now displays products that merchants have added to the public catalog through **Product** > **Edit page** > **Shared Catalog**. Previously, these items appeared if added  through **Catalog** > **Shared Catalog**, but not through **Product** > **Edit page** > **Shared Catalog**.

<!-- MAGETWO-89296  -->

*  Menus now close as expected from the Quick Order page in mobile view.

### Bundle products

<!-- MAGETWO-88810  -->

*  Bundle product SKUs are now built based on the order of the associated (selected) product ID numbers in ascending order. Previously, SKUs were built based on the order of the selected product ID numbers in ascending order instead of the order in which the option is added to the bundle product.

<!-- ENGCOM-2997  -->

*  Magento no longer overwrites user-defined option quantities with default values when a customer edits a bundle product from a shopping cart. *Fix submitted by Joseph Maxwell in pull request [15905](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15905)*. [GitHub-4942](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/4942)

<!-- ENGCOM-3275  -->

*  Bundle special prices are now correctly rounded when you load and resave a bundle product. Previously, when you reloaded a bundle with a special price that requires four positions after the decimal (for example, 78,9473), Magento rounded the price to two decimal places. *Fix submitted by magently in pull request [17971](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/17971)*. [GitHub-17638](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17638)

<!-- MAGETWO-90381  -->

*  Magento now maintains the correct base price for a bundle product when you add a bundle product in one currency and then add the same bundle product option in a different currency. Previously, when you added the same bundle product option in a different currency, Magento doubled the base price.

### CAPTCHA

<!-- MAGETWO-93780  -->

*  CAPTCHA now appears as expected in the Log in popup window.

### Catalog

<!-- ENGCOM-3392  -->

*  Magento now correctly calculates fixed tier price discount for products with special prices. *Fix submitted by Vishal Gelani in pull request [18743](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18743)*. [GitHub-18652](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18652)

<!-- MAGETWO-69650  -->

*  Products no longer display discounted prices in the shopping cart unless discounts have been applied or special or tiered prices are in effect.

<!-- MAGETWO-73140  -->

*  Categories that are set to anchor **Yes** and that have disabled subcategories no longer display  products from those disabled subcategories. [GitHub-9002](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9002)

<!-- MAGETWO-96288  -->

*  You can now use REST to update category positions.

<!-- MAGETWO-95556  -->

*  Magnifier now correctly handles zoomed sections of images when the image width/height ratio has a `~2x` difference. Previously, these sections were distorted.

<!-- MAGETWO-95461  -->

*  You can now save products with at least one tier price.

<!-- MAGETWO-95122  -->

*  Magento now saves default values for category URL paths in accordance with the **Use Default Value**  and **Create a Permanent Redirect** settings. Previously, in deployments running multiple stores, if a category's URL key was changed and saved, Magento did not change the category's URL key back to the default URL key when saved with the **Use Default Value** box checked and **Create a Permanent Redirect** box unchecked.

<!-- MAGETWO-73687  -->

*  Magento now retains across categories any value you set for the number of categories displayed per page.

<!-- MAGETWO-73449  -->

*  Changes to product images made under the All Stores scope now affect product images at the store-view level.

<!-- MAGETWO-93149  -->

*  You can now successfully change and save product order when you use a rule that implements a `contains` condition operator in Virtual Merchandiser. Previously, Magento did not save product position as expected.

<!-- MAGETWO-91070  -->

*  Category pages now display products  when swatch images are missing. Previously, Magento did not display these products, and the console displayed this error message, `Error: [object Object]`.

<!-- ENGCOM-4089  -->

*  Removed unnecessary slash from `app/code/Magento/CatalogInventory/etc/di.xml`. This extraneous slash had previously resulted in `Magento\Catalog\Api\ProductRenderListInterface` returning products regardless of visibility. *Fix submitted by Milind Singh in pull request [20886](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20886)*. [GitHub-20409](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20409)

<!-- MAGETWO-73342  -->

*  Customers can change product status by clicking on the toggle element or by clicking on label text, but not by clicking the area around a toggle element. Previously, if a customer  clicked on the area around a toggle element, Magento changed the state of the element. Unintended results could occur if a customer mistakenly clicked on the area around the element and didn't realize that the status had  changed.

<!-- ENGCOM-2930  -->

*  Updates to related products now appear as expected in both the storefront product page and the Admin product edit page. Previously, the storefront displayed product updates, but not all related product updates showed up in the Admin. *Fix submitted by Pieter Hoste in pull request [17885](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/17885)*. [GitHub-14050](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14050)

[GitHub-13405](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13405)

<!-- ENGCOM-3047  -->

*  `getStoreId()` now consistently returns `int`. *Fix submitted by sv3n in pull request [18086](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18086)*. [GitHub-18079](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18079)

<!-- ENGCOM-3097  -->

*  You can now set a Boolean attribute to `is_filterable`, which allows them to be included in layered navigation. *Fix submitted by Mr. Lewis in pull request [17823](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/17823)*. [GitHub-3283](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/3283)

<!-- ENGCOM-3050  -->

*  If you create a catalog price rule based on categories with a nesting level 4 or higher, these categories now maintain the status of their checkboxes when you re-open Category Chooser. Previously, when you reopened these categories, no checkboxes were checked.  *Fix submitted by magently in pull request [18175](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18175)*. [GitHub-17493](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17493)

<!-- ENGCOM-3133  -->

[GitHub-9219](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9219)

<!-- ENGCOM-3171  -->

*  Magento now validates the quantity of items in the shopping cart against the **Maximum Qty Allowed in Shopping Cart** setting. *Fix submitted by Vishal Gelani in pull request [18552](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18552)*. [GitHub-18477](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18477)

<!-- ENGCOM-3193  -->

*  When a new customer is created, Magento sets a value of zero for any custom attribute if no other value is explicitly provided. Previously, if no value was explicitly assigned, Magento did not save the custom attribute with any value. *Fix submitted by Oleksandr Kravchuk in pull request [16915](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16915)*. [GitHub-14510](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14510)

<!-- ENGCOM-3230  -->

*  `\Magento\Catalog\Model\Product::getQty()` now consistently returns float/double. *Fix submitted by Mr. Lewis in pull request [18424](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18424)*. [GitHub-18094](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18094)

<!-- ENGCOM-3373  -->

*  Performance has improved for sessions where  customers browse many product pages. (This performance boost is a result of replacing the jQuery `localStorage` API  with native `localStorage` in `app/code/Magento/Catalog/view/frontend/web/js/product/storage/data-storage.js` and  `app/code/Magento/Catalog/view/frontend/web/js/product/storage/ids-storage.js`.) *Fix submitted by Oleksandr Miroshnichenko in pull request [19014](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19014)*.

Previously, the deleted image remained in `pub\media\catalog\category`. *Fix submitted by p-bystritsky in pull request [20178](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20178)*. [GitHub-16198](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/16198)

<!-- MAGETWO-95898  -->

*  Customers can now configure options for a configurable product after adding it to their shopping cart.  Previously, under these circumstances, Magento threw a fatal error.

<!-- MAGETWO-95067  -->

*  Checkout information now persists after a cart update. Information previously entered by a customer during check out (such as shipping address) now persists after the customer updates their shopping cart.

### CMS

<!-- MAGETWO-94154  -->

*  Files and folders that are symlinked in `pub/media` can now be deleted from the media gallery browser.

*  The WYSIWYG editor no longer arbitrarily removes `aria-role` attributes from  `div` in CMS pages or blocks.

### Customer

<!-- MAGETWO-81818  -->

<!-- ENGCOM-3052  -->

*  Magento now maintains alphabetical order for customer groups when you filter customers by group in the Admin.  Previously, groups were sorted by ID. *Fix submitted by Dmytro Cheshun in pull request [18280](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18280)*. [GitHub-18101](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18101)

<!-- ENGCOM-3082  -->

*  Magento now saves customer custom attributes as expected when  EAV caching is disabled.  Previously, directly saving customer information resulted in data loss. *Fix submitted by Francesco Haymar d'Ettory in pull request [17968](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/17968)*. [GitHub-12479](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12479)

<!-- MAGETWO-96079  -->

<!-- MAGETWO-93072  -->

*  Magento now displays the value of a custom customer address attribute  in the column for that attribute when you create a custom customer address attribute and set it to be displayed in the Columns list.  Previously, Magento added the customer code column to the Customer table, but left these columns blank.

<!-- MAGETWO-74169  -->

*  Magento displays no traces of the store credit functionality on the front end when you set **Store Credit Functionality** to **no** when installing Magento. [GitHub-5609](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/5609)

### Customer custom attributes

<!-- MAGETWO-89039  -->

*  Customer address attribute validation during checkout now permits spaces.

<!-- MAGETWO-95059  -->

*  Magento now adds the address entered during checkout to a new account when a custom address attribute is required when creating a user account after checkout.

### Developer

<!-- ENGCOM-2940  -->

*  You can now print order information from the customer dashboard.

[GitHub-10440](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10440)

### Directory

<!-- ENGCOM-2747  -->

*  Australian country regions are now available from the drop-down menu that Magento displays during the checkout address population steps. *Fix submitted by Maxim Baibakov in pull request [17516](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/17516)*. [GitHub-17514](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17514)

### Downloadable

<!-- ENGCOM-3385  -->

*  The order confirmation email sent to the customer during  guest checkout now includes download links for purchased downloadable products as expected. *Fix submitted by Oleksandr Kravchuk in pull request [19036](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19036)*. [GitHub-10934](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10934),

[GitHub-19344](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19344)

### EAV

<!-- ENGCOM-3128  -->

*  Magento no longer changes the ute source_model when you create an attribute option through the API. Previously, the `source_model` of an EAV attribute was set to `Magento\Eav\Model\Entity\Attribute\Source\Table` when updating an EAV attribute's options through the API. This eliminated the ability to update this attribute's options through the Admin. *Fix submitted by Pieter Hoste in pull request [18390](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18390)*. [GitHub-13156](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13156)

<!-- ENGCOM-3215  -->

*  Magento no longer throws an SQL Join error when you use a custom EAV entity  with the `standard eav_entity` entity table. Previously, this usage resulted in an integrity constraint violation. *Fix submitted by Oleksii Lisovyi in pull request [18566](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18566)*. [GitHub-18532](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18532)

<!-- ENGCOM-3740  -->

*  Newly added links on the customer dashboard are now shown as current as expected when the link path has been constructed from both default and new elements. Previously, the link was added, but not shown in the current state as expected. *Fix submitted by Eduard Chitoraga in pull request [19927](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19927)*. [GitHub-19099](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19099)

<!-- ENGCOM-3359  -->

*  Class `\Magento\Framework\Data\Form\Element\Fieldset` now calls the `getBeforeElementHtml` method. *Fix submitted by Burlacu Vasilii in pull request [18985](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18985)*. [GitHub-2618](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/2618)

<!-- ENGCOM-2942  -->

*  The `bin/magento module:uninstall` command  now works as expected with Composer. Previously, there was a discrepancy between `composer.lock` and `composer.json` when this command was used to remove a module. *Fix submitted by Francesco Haymar d'Ettory in pull request [18002](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18002)*. [GitHub-5797](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/5797)

<!-- ENGCOM-3172  -->

*  Magento now throws `LogicException($message, 0, $e)` instead of `LogicException($message)` as needed when running validation for communication configuration (`communication.xml`).  Previously, the  validator in `Magento\Framework\Communication\Config\Validator` did not propagate exceptions, which obscured the cause of the error. *Fix submitted by Vishal Gelani in pull request [18554](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18554)*. [GitHub-14555](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14555)

<!-- MAGETWO-87297  -->

*  Module names can now contain numbers. Previously, `magento/framework-message-queue/etc/queue_base.xml` contained a pattern that did not allow numbers to be used in `instanceType`, which resulted in the invalidation of custom message consumers in this file.

<!-- MAGETWO-95779  -->

*  Attributes in flat tables are now updated after the product is saved when the catalog product flat index is turned on and the indexer is set to **Save on Update**.

<!-- MAGETWO-93183  -->

<!-- ENGCOM-3568  -->

*  Interceptor class methods now support nullable return types. *Fix submitted by Oleksandr Kravchuk in pull request [19398](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19398)*. [GitHub-15505](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15505)

<!-- ENGCOM-3479  -->

*  Magento can now read responses from third-party servers that use HTTP/2 if your server also uses HTTP/2. Previously, this inability to read requests from third-party servers that use HTTP/2 prevented access to Magento Marketplace. *Fix submitted by Vishal Gelani in pull request [19239](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19239)*. [GitHub-19127](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19127)

<!-- ENGCOM-3424  -->

*  The node in `events.xml`  can now have child nodes. Previously, a cache flush triggered an exception. *Fix submitted by Lisovyi Yevhenii in pull request [19145](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19145)*. [GitHub-15931](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15931)

#### Cache framework

<!-- MAGETWO-73528  -->

*  Problems with cache-cleaning for product pages for simple  products associated with configurable products  have been resolved. and as a result, product pages now now accurately display out-of-stock status.  Previously, when an associated product went out-of-stock, Magento did not update the product page of the configurable product unless you cleaned the cache. [GitHub-8009](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8009)

<!-- MAGETWO-69766  -->

*  The images cache can now be flushed from the Admin (**Admin** > **System** > **Cache Management** and click **Flush Catalog Images Cache**). Previously, you could not delete the directory, and Magento displayed an error on the cache management page.

#### JavaScript framework

<!-- MAGETWO-74160  -->

*  Wishlist names can now contain apostrophes. Previously, a wishlist whose name contained an apostrophe could not be edited or deleted.

### General

<!-- MAGETWO-89377  -->

<!-- ENGCOM-3301  -->

*  Removed use of `escapeJS` method in  `app/code/Magento/SendFriend/view/frontend/templates/send.phtml`. *Fix submitted by Rahul Mahto in pull request [18886](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18886)*. [GitHub-18779](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18779)

<!-- MAGETWO-94423  -->

*  You can now hide an image as expected by using the `hide_from_product_page` attribute during import.

<!-- MAGETWO-91283  -->

*  Magento now retains product order within a category after import.

<!-- MAGETWO-74012  -->

[GitHub-17954](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17954)

<!-- MAGETWO-88736  -->

*  Magento now displays an informative `You have unsubscribed` message when you click the unsubscribe link in the newsletter email.

<!-- ENGCOM-3680  -->

### Shipping

<!-- MAGETWO-c  -->

*  Magento now uses the  shipping table rate from the correct store in multistore deployments.

<!-- MAGETWO-73894  -->

*  You can now use `GET .V1/shipments` to search for shipments that contain a shipping label. Previously, using this call  caused Magento to throw an exception. [GitHub-6668](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/6668)

<!-- MAGETWO-91105  -->

*  Table rates now work as expected when using the AE code (Armed Forces Europe) when calculating weight vs destination table rates.

<!-- MAGETWO-96156  -->

*  Shipments that are created through REST now return tracking information as expected. Previously, Magento created shipment notifications without a tracking number when shipment was created using REST.

<!-- MAGETWO-95497  -->

*  Magento now correctly handles U.K. shipping addresses in multisite deployments where the default store's  **Allowed Countries** setting is US only but the store from which the order is placed supports U. K. shipping. Previously, Magento did not complete the order set to ship to a U.K. address, and  displayed this error, `Please check the shipping address information. Invalid value of "GB" provided for the countryId field`.

<!-- ENGCOM-4042  -->

*  Fixed misalignment of elements on the shipping information page that Magento displays when you click **Check Out with Multiple Addresses** from the shopping cart. *Fix submitted by Amol Chaudhari in pull request [20739](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20739)*. [GitHub-20563](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20563)

<!-- ENGCOM-3008  -->

*  Sitemaps now display correct base URLs for deployments with  multiple stores. *Fix submitted by Toan Nguyen in pull request [18000](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18000)*. [GitHub-17999](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17999)

### Staging

<!-- MAGETWO-86541  -->

*  Updates containing zero objects are now removed as expected from the dashboard. Previously, Magento did not remove updates with zero objects.

<!-- MAGETWO-73332  -->

*  The staging dashboard now loads without freezing.

<!-- MAGETWO-67135  -->

*  An administrator  with a custom (limited) role can now edit and schedule  updates to CMS content pages.

<!-- MAGETWO-86102  -->

*  Restricted users with access to specified sections can now save a scheduled update. Previously, Magento threw a `forbidden` error.

### Store

<!-- ENGCOM-3737  -->

*  Calling `getCurrentUrl` on a store no longer adds the  `___store` parameter when **store code in URL** is set to **yes** and the current store is not the same store requested in the URL. *Fix submitted by Nazar in pull request [19945](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19945)*. [GitHub-18941](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18941)

### Swatches

<!-- ENGCOM-3383  -->

*  An administrator with appropriate permissions  can now change a product's default swatch option from the Admin. *Fix submitted by Rostislav Sabischenko in pull request [19012](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19012)*. [GitHub-8348](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8348)

<!-- ENGCOM-2912  -->

*  Store views now show the correct swatch values. *Fix submitted by Misha Medzhytov in pull request [17891](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/17891)*. [GitHub-17890](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17890)

<!-- MAGETWO-73862  -->

*  You can now change the size of a swatch image as expected. [GitHub-6382](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/6382)

### TargetRule

<!-- MAGETWO-95420  -->

*  Magento no longer throws a fatal error when price is used in a Target Rule for actions.

<!-- MAGETWO-87678  -->

*  Magento no longer throws an exception when Target Rules are set to a rotation mode other than **SHUFFLE**. (You can set rotation modes in **Admin** > **System** > **Configurations** > **Catalog** > **Catalog** > **Rule-Based Product Relations**.)

### Tax

<!-- MAGETWO-94179  -->

*  Tax is now calculated as expected for virtual products when PayPal is used as a payment method.

<!-- ENGCOM-3319  -->

*  Magento no longer uses the default tax information set in **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Sales** > **Tax** customer, quote, and order data.  *Fix submitted by Nirav Kadiya in pull request [18857](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18857)*. [GitHub-16684](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/16684)

### Testing

<!-- ENGCOM-3410  -->

<!-- ENGCOM-3875  -->

*  `magentoDataIsolation` has been replaced with `magentoDbIsolation` as needed in several integration tests. *Fix submitted by p-bystritsky in pull request [20298](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20298)*. [GitHub-20296](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20296)

<!-- ENGCOM-3021  -->

*  Integration tests now respect module status as defined in `config-global.php`.  This permits you to enable only the modules you typically keep enabled while still saving system resources. *Fix submitted by Jisse Reitsma in pull request [16361](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16361)*. [GitHub-15196](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15196)

### Theme

<!-- MAGETWO-74208  -->

*  Text now remains in the header area when you resize a page in deployments running in Internet Explorer.

*  We've improved the display of the navigation menu on mobile deployments. Previously, Magento displayed only a portion of any submenu accessed from a top menu.

<!-- MAGETWO-94455  -->

*  The user agent rule now sets correct templates for product pages. Previously, the `footer.phtml` and `absolute_footer.phtml` templates were loaded from the desktop theme instead of the mobile theme, regardless of the user agent.

<!-- MAGETWO-87027  -->

*  The text attribute implemented on the product page within the mobile theme now fluidly displays the entire text value. Previously, long values were truncated.

<!-- MAGETWO-94462  -->

*  All thumbnails reload as expected after you click on a configurable option when a configurable product detail page has more than 14 thumbnail images. Previously, not all thumbnails reloaded.

<!-- ENGCOM-3672  -->

### UI

<!-- ENGCOM-3973  -->

*  Image files can no longer be uploaded to Admin category pages  by dragging when the upload field has been disabled. *Fix submitted by Serhiy Zhovnir in pull request [20636](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20636)*. [GitHub-20376](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20376)

<!-- ENGCOM-4012  -->

*  Store switcher now works correctly on mobile devices. *Fix submitted by Rajneesh Gupta in pull request [20540](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20540)*. [GitHub-20259](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20259)

<!-- ENGCOM-3308  -->

*  Missing asterisks have been added where needed on the Admin. *Fix submitted by Dmytro Cheshun in pull request [18905](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18905)*. [GitHub-18904](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18904)

<!-- ENGCOM-3306  -->

<!-- ENGCOM-3174  -->

*  Admin tables now work as expected when single store mode is set to **on**. Previously, column positioning in these tables was not preserved when the page was refreshed. *Fix submitted by Vishal Gelani in pull request [18561](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18561)*. [GitHub-12070](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12070)

<!-- ENGCOM-3177  -->

*  Magento now regenerates product URL rewrites as expected after an administrator changes a product URL key from the Admin and subsequently saves the product attribute URL path value. Previously, product URL rewrites could not be generated after this attribute value was changed. *Fix submitted by Oleksii Lisovyi in pull request [18566](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18566)*. [GitHub-5929](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/5929)

<!-- ENGCOM-3313  -->

*  You can now use the `OptionManagement.delete` method to programmatically delete a product attribute that converts to false. Previously, Magento threw an exception. *Fix submitted by Vishal Gelani in pull request [18873](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18873)*. [GitHub-13083](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13083)

<!-- MAGETWO-91403  -->

*  WYSIWYG editor functionality is now available in all rows of the dynamic rows UI component. Previously, this functionality was available in the first row only.

### URL rewrite

<!-- MAGETWO-86419  -->

*  Product URLs are now based on the configuration information from the Admin, not the order of records in the database. Previously, the order of records in the database affected the generated URL, and some products showed category paths for product URLS when **Use Categories Path for Product URLs** was set to **no**.

<!-- MAGETWO-94860  -->

*  The storefront now properly displays the order of categories when you move categories in the Admin.

<!-- MAGETWO-93424  -->

*  Attempts to rewrite catalog URLs with `POST /V1/products` endpoint now  work as expected. [GitHub-16789](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/16789)

<!-- MAGETWO-89619  -->

*  Magento no longer ignores the store-level `url_key` of child categories when rewriting URLs process for global scope. [GitHub-13513](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13513)

<!-- MAGETWO-86303  -->

*  Magento now correctly updates existing product URLs during import. Previously, Magento updated existing URLs with the new URLs, but displayed a 404 error if you tried to access the product from the new URL.

<!-- ENGCOM-3175  -->

*  The upsert category process during product import now generates freshly created category URL rewrites globally and not just for the default scope. Previously, Magento created URL rewrites for the default website scope only. *Fix submitted by Vishal Gelani in pull request [18563](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18563)*. [GitHub-18234](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18234)

### Visual Merchandiser

<!-- MAGETWO-91019  -->

*  Visual Merchandiser now correctly sorts configurable product prices in Tile view.

### Web API framework

<!-- MAGETWO-73526  -->

*  You can now create products with same name. Previously, Magento did not create the second  product and displayed this error, `Error "URL key for specified store already exists`.

<!-- MAGETWO-86344  -->

*  Product searches using `GET V1/products` return `extension_attributes` for configurable products as expected.

<!-- MAGETWO-73061  -->

*  The response for `GET V1/orders/:orderId` now contains `bundle_option` and `product_option` information as expected.

<!-- ENGCOM-3929  -->

*  `Magento\Framework\Webapi\Rest\Response\Renderer` class's  `_formatValue` method has been refactored to handle ampersands correctly. Previously, an ampersand in any customer text field when using the WebApi doubled the encoding. [GitHub-18361](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18361)

### Widget

<!-- MAGETWO-85683  -->

*  Magento now correctly renders apostrophes as entered in text fields.

<!-- MAGETWO-93947  -->

*  The product page's Recently Viewed section no longer displays the name of the current product.

<!-- ENGCOM-4037  -->

*  Fixed alignment of options on the Admin edit widget page. *Fix submitted by Amol Chaudhari in pull request [20270](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20270)*. [GitHub-20113](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20113)

### Wishlist

<!-- ENGCOM-3344  -->

*  Default configured values are now rendering on the wishlist product edit page. *Fix submitted by Ratnesh Kumar in pull request [18967](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18967)*. [GitHub-18555](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18555)

<!-- MAGETWO-90812  -->

*  Registered users can now create new wishlists as expected when multiple wishlists are enabled. Previously, Magento displayed an error.

<!-- MAGETWO-93035  -->

*  Magento no longer retains entries for deleted products in the database `wishlist_item_option` table.

### WYSIWG

<!-- ENGCOM-3291  -->

*  The `id_prefix` option for the cache frontend, which is used to prefix cache keys, is now set when Magento is installed. Previously, the performance of all websites in multisite deployments was uneven due to the previous mechanism used to prefix cache keys. *Fix submitted by [Fabian Schmengler](https://github.com/schmengler) in pull request [18641](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18641)*. [GitHub-15828](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15828)

## Known issues

**Issue**: Cart Price rules that were created with undefined end dates (that is, with the  **To** field left empty) are not displayed as expected on the Staging dashboard after  upgrading from Magento Open Source to Magento Commerce 2.3.1. <!--- MC-15317-->

**Issue**:  The CGI URL gateway in the UPS module has been updated from HTTP to HTTPS. Consequently, the UPS shipping method does not populate correctly. **Workaround**: Confirm that the Gateway URL uses the HTTPS protocol in the [UPS Shipping Method Configuration](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/configuration/sales/shipping-methods.html). <!--- MAGETWO-98947-->

*Updating an existing setting*:

If UPS Type is set to `United Parcel Service` in the UPS Shipping Method Configuration, you must manually change the protocol of the Gateway URL from HTTP to HTTPS. Example: `https://www.ups.com/using/services/rave/qcostcgi.cgi`

*To configure UPS for the first time*:

1. Navigate to **Stores**  > **Settings**  > **Configuration**  >  **Sales**  > **Shipping Methods**. Then, expand the **UPS** section.

1. At the **UPS Type** field, clear the Use system value checkbox. Then, change **UPS Type** to `United Parcel Service XML`. The Gateway URL populates correctly when this value is selected.

1. Tap **Save Config**.
