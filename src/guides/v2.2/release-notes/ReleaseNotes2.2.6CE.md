title: Magento Open Source 2.2.6 Release Notes
---

*Patch code and release notes were published on September 18, 2018 and last revised October 29, 2018.*

We are pleased to present Magento Open Source 2.2.6. This release includes 25 critical enhancements to product security, over 150 core code fixes and enhancements, and over 350 community-submitted pull requests.

Although this release includes these security enhancements, no confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions, so we recommend that you upgrade your Magento software to the latest version as soon as possible.

See [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-2.2.6-and-2.1.15-security-update) for a comprehensive discussion of these issues. All exploitable security issues fixed in this release (2.2.6) have been ported to 2.1.15, 1.14.3.10, and 1.9.3.10, as appropriate.

## Highlights

In addition to 25 critical security fixes, look for the following highlights in this release:

### Core code highlights

This release includes significant performance improvements to the core Magento code:

#### **Substantial improvements to performance**

Performance-tuning enhancements focus on catalog indexing and include:

<!-- MAGETWO-87430  -->

*  Category product indexer logic has been optimized, and re-indexing time has decreased up to 98%, from 40 minutes to one minute for 100,000 categories.  Previously, when your store contained many categories (100,0000), Magento could take up to 40 minutes to re-index product catalogs.

<!-- MAGETWO-91164  -->

*  The `catalog:images:resize` command execution time has been reduced by up to 90% in the release. However, this improvement necessitates these additional steps after upgrading your Magento instance to 2.2.6:

   *  Remove   `pub/media/catalog/product/cache` . (Removing this folder frees up space.)

   *  Run `bin/magento catalog:images:resize`  to generate a new image cache.  (This step is necessary because we’ve changed the path to cached images and must remove the previously cached images.)

<!-- MAGETWO-47320  -->

*  The catalog rule re-indexing operation has been optimized, and the average re-indexing time (which depends on rule conditions) has improved by more than  80%.  Previously, a full catalog rule re-index operation on a medium B2C store took more than 20 minutes.

<!-- MAGETWO-92447  -->

*  The catalog price indexer is now scoped and multithreaded, which improves the performance of layered navigation, search, and indexing actions for Magento instances with multiple websites and stores. This makes it possible to parallelize catalog price indexing by websites and customer groups. To re-index in parallel mode, add the `MAGE_INDEXER_THREADS_COUNT` environment variable to `env.php`.

<!-- MAGETWO-90572  -->

*  The time required to load category or product pages for products that are configured with many attributes (more than 500) has been significantly reduced. Refactoring the logic for product attribute retrieval has resulted in a reduction of load time of almost 90% for scenarios with a large number of product attribute sets. (Performance will not noticeably improve for deployments with only one attribute set configured with 500 attributes. However, deployments with many attribute sets that contain only a few attributes will show significant performance improvement. For example, a deployment with 100 attribute sets, each of which contains 50 attributes, might see a 40-90% reduction in load time.)

<!-- MAGETWO-88670  -->

*  The time required to load a store’s home page has been reduced noticeably when the top menu contains many categories.  (Load time is still affected by the number of categories and the structure of the top menu.)

<!-- MAGETWO-86143  -->

*  Merchants can now improve store performance by disabling Magento Report functionality. A new configuration setting  (**System Configuration:** **General** > **Reports** > **General Options**) allows merchants to disable Magento Reports, which is recommended practice  if a merchant's business function does not require this capability.

#### **Improvements to the reliability and ease of the checkout process**

<!-- MAGETWO-86490  -->

*  A shopping cart’s contents remain constant even when the checkout page is repeatedly reloaded. Previously, if a customer reloaded the checkout page several times, Magento emptied the shopping cart, and the customer could not place the order. (This problem primarily affected stores running on HTTPS.)

<!-- MAGETWO-90053 -->

*  Refreshing the checkout page no longer deletes the shipping address when a guest checks out. Previously, when the persistent shopping cart was enabled, refreshing the checkout page affected information entered into form fields for a guest checkout.

<!-- MAGETWO-89222 -->

*  The speed at which Magento places an order is no longer affected by how many shipping methods are available. Previously, when a customer placed an order for which multiple shipping methods were available, Magento took more than 20 seconds to place the order.

#### **Additional enhancements**

<!-- MAGETWO-86125 -->

*  Configurable products are now sorted by visible prices  as expected. Previously, sorting a catalog by price produced sort results that included the prices of out-of-stock products and disabled child products.

<!-- MAGETWO-91411  -->

*  Magento no longer sends duplicate delete requests as a result of an unstable Internet connection. Previously, unintentional mass deletion of products sometimes occurred as a result of an unstable Internet connection.

### **Magento Cloud highlights**

*  We've added a [Docker Compose]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/docker/docker-config.html) configuration to the Cloud `ece-tools` repository for deploying a local development environment.

*  Merchants can now [change store locales]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/live/sens-data-over.html#change-locales) without the exporting and importing configuration process.

*  A new [workflow]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/trouble/robots-sitemap.html) lets merchant add a `robots.txt` file and generate a `sitemap.xml` file for a single domain configuration without requiring a change to the infrastructure.

*  Merchants can now define multiple locales for each theme using the new [`SCD_MATRIX`]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/env/variables-deploy.html#scd_matrix) environment variable, which reduces the amount of theme files to deploy.

*  Zero-downtime deployment has been implemented through a “connection holding” capability, which ensures no lost connections or site unavailability, providing smooth shopper experience even during deployments involving database schema changes.

*  We've fixed an issue that caused downtime between the deploy and post-deploy phase. Now, the `post_deploy` phase begins immediately after the deploy phase ends.

### **Community contribution highlights**

Highlights of community contributions include fixes that improve checkout flow and the sorting of simple products:

*  Customers can now successfully complete an order when it contains a  configurable product with an option that is deleted after the product has been placed in the shopping cart. Previously, the shopping cart could not load the shopping cart after the configurable option was deleted.  Thanks to community member jonshipman!  [GitHub-15467](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15467)

*  Magento now maintains the default sort order for products (“newest first”) when you upgrade your Magento deployment. Previously, after upgrade, the default product order in categories changed from “newest first” to “oldest first”.  Thanks to community member Danny Verkade! [GitHub-15627](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15627)

*  Merchants can now successfully change the applied theme setting for a store view (**Content** > **Design** > **Configuration**).  Thanks to community member Daniel Ruf! [GitHub-14968](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14968)

*  Magento loads pages faster because it no longer redundantly calculates product taxes when loading category pages. Thanks to community member JeroenVanLeusden! [GitHub-14941](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14941)

### **Core bundled extension highlights**

This release includes many enhancements to our core bundled extensions:

#### Amazon Pay

Enhancements to Amazon Pay include these features:

*  Implementation of the  [Magento payment provider gateway]({{ page.baseurl }}/payments-integrations/payment-gateway/payment-gateway-intro.html), which provides developers a mechanism for integrating stores with payment providers.

*  Improved handling of virtual products.

*  New entry in the Admin that allows  Amazon Pay to be displayed in the list of payment options.

*  Combined `Synchronous, if possible` and `Asynchronous` settings for authorization mode into one setting. Current settings are now `Immediate` (previously `Synchronous`) and `Automatic` (a combination of the previous `Synchronous, if possible` and `Asynchronous`).

#### dotmailer

Enhancements to dotmailer include these new features:

*  You can now request and capture the consent of customers and guests using dotmailer’s new Consent Insight.

*  You can import only those Magento contacts who have opted in (customer subscribers, guest subscribers, and other subscribers).

*  A warning alerts you when you are about to sync non-subscribers into a dotmailer account.

*  Improvements have been made to the retry process that results after a failed attempt to access EDC.

#### Klarna

Enhancements to Klarna include support for these new features:

*  The Klarna Payments section now includes a link to Klarna automated onboarding and account sign in.

*  If an approved order is later identified as fraudulent, Klarna notifies the merchant and requests that they try to stop the order from being delivered. In addition, Klarna attempts to cancel the order automatically by sending notification to the merchant. See [Managing Your Account](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/payment/klarna-manage.html) for more information.

*  Shipping and discount order lines have been added to order management calls.

*  Klarna now passes shipping details in capture requests.

*  The Klarna API now returns the name and logo URL to use for each payment method instead of hard-coding the payment method names into the module.

For more information on these new features, see [Klarna](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/payment/klarna.html).

#### Magento Shipping

*  **Batch Processing** provides merchants with the ability to

   *  Specify and modify packages and experiences for orders assigned to a batch

   *  Book shipments for a batch

   *  Print all packing slips and printing labels for the batch

*  New **Shipment Reference**  field associates bookings between a carrier and a customer

#### Magento Social

Magento has removed the  Magento Social  Facebook integration, and no longer supports the extension.

Looking for more information on these new features as well as many others? Check out [Magento Developer Documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/v2.2/) and the [Magento Commerce User Guide](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/getting-started.html).

## Fixes
In addition to security enhancements, this release contains the following functional fixes.

### Installation, setup, and deployment

<!-- ENGCOM-1537  -->

*  You can now use the `app:config:status` command to check whether configuration propagation is up-to-date. (This fix restores this command, which was inadvertently deleted in a previous release.)  *Fix submitted by Pieter Hoste in pull request [15174](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15174)*. [GitHub-14104](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14104)

<!-- MAGETWO-84651  -->

*  The `app:config:dump` command now has an argument that supports dumping only the specified settings that are required to prepare static content on a build system, not all system settings. This new option (`config-types`) makes it possible to dump scopes and themes automatically (which are needed for a build system) while managing system settings manually using `config:set --lock-config`. *Fix submitted by Juan Alonso in pull request [12410](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/12410)*. [GitHub-11396](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11396)

<!-- MAGETWO-93192  -->

*  Configuration backend models are now populated as expected with all fieldset data, which makes it possible to access all configured values from a current group. [GitHub-16712](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/16712)

<!-- MAGETWO-90860  -->

*  The `magento-deploy-ignore` setting in `composer.json` now works as expected. Previously, files specified in this setting were overwritten during deployment.

<!-- MAGETWO-87120  -->

*  The `timestamp` fields in `oauth_nonce` now include indexes to avoid deadlocks while erasing old records. *Fix submitted by Carlos Lizaga in pull request [13328](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/13328)*. [GitHub-10346](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10346)

<!-- ENGCOM-1972  -->

*  Sorting has been disabled in the  `glob` and `scandir` functions to improve performance. *Fix submitted by Leandro F. L. in pull request [16052](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16052)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-2407  -->

*  The `nginx.config.sample` file no longer includes an option for PHP 5.x. (Magento 2.2.x is not compatible with PHP 5.x.) *Fix submitted by Sean Breeden in pull request [16883](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16883)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-2315  -->

*  Autoloading performance has improved on production environments as a result of the reduction in `file_exists` calls. *Fix submitted by Pieter Hoste in pull request [16435](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16435)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-2029  -->

*  Setting deploy mode to production mode by  using the `--skip-compilation` flag no longer clears generated code in `generated/code/` and `generated/metadata/`. *Fix submitted by platformvaimo in pull request [16211](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16211)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-1673  -->

*  We've made two changes to `Magento/Config` module: `Magento/Config/Test/Unit/Block/System/Config/Form/Field/ImageTest.php::testGetElementHtmlWithValue()` method no longer references a invalid backend model, and  the anonymous function no longer has an unused `$data` in `Magento/Config/Model/Config/Importer.php`. *Fix submitted by Marcel Hauri in pull request [15511](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15511)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-1448  -->

*  The upgrade check implemented during setup now indicates success if the latest version of Magento is already installed. Previously, the message indicated that the latest product version was already installed was presented as error. *Fix submitted by Daniel Ruf in pull request [15012](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15012)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-1431  -->

*  The **Add Block Names to Hints** configuration setting has been renamed to **Add Block Class Type to Hints**. *Fix submitted by Chris Pook in pull request [14939](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/14939)*.

<!-- MAGETWO-93758  -->

*  The `cron:run` command now reads `cron/enabled` configuration setting and if this value is set to **1** (the default value), then the `cron:run` command will execute. A value of **0** determines that `cron:run` will not be executed, and prompts Magento to send the customer email indicating that `cron` is disabled.

<!-- MAGETWO-93981 -->

*  New command-line interface (CLI) commands support setting and showing indexer dimension modes:

   *  `bin/magento indexer:set-dimensions-mode`  sets  indexer dimensions mode

   *  `bin/magento indexer:show-dimensions-mode` shows dimensions mode of indexer

### Amazon Pay

<!-- BUNDLE-1453  -->

*  Amazon Pay no longer appears as an option during checkout when a customer selects  **Check Out with Multiple Addresses**. Previously, Magento displayed Amazon Pay as an option, even though Amazon Pay does not support multishipping.

<!-- BUNDLE-1324  -->

*  You can now change and save Amazon Pay configuration settings from **Configuration**  > **Sales** > **Payment Methods**  > **Amazon Pay** when deploying Magento in a Cloud environment. Previously, Magento did not save changed settings.

### Bundle products

<!-- MAGETWO-90999  -->

*  Magento now successfully imports bundle products. Previously, bundle products were not visible in the product catalog, and were listed as out-of-stock on the storefront.

<!--  ENGCOM-1863 -->

*  The `Magento_Bundle` module name has been added to the relevant template files to meet Magento standard coding format. *Fix submitted by Namrata in pull request [15825](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15825)*.

<!--  ENGCOM-2176 -->

*  The `option` variable has been renamed to `quoteItemOption` to improve code readability in `app/code/Magento/Bundle/Model/Product/Type.php`. *Fix submitted by Leandro F. L. in pull request [16143](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16143)*.

<!-- MAGETWO-86218 -->

*  Magento now accurately displays the status of bundle product stock when **Add to Cart** is enabled for bundle products. Previously, bundle products with the **User Defined** field unchecked could not be back ordered as expected. [GitHub-10061](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10061)

### Catalog

<!-- ENGCOM-1539  -->

*  The breadcrumbs component no longer relies on the `mageMenu` widget. *Fix submitted by Vova Yatsyuk in pull request [15178](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15178)*. [GitHub-14987](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14987)

<!-- ENGCOM-1622  -->

*  The `data-container` class name is now based on view mode. *Fix submitted by sunilit42 in pull request [15350](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15350)*. [GitHub-15319](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15319)

<!-- ENGCOM-1617  -->

*  Breadcrumbs now work as expected when a product name contains quotation marks. Previously, the breadcrumbs on the product details page caused this syntax error to be thrown, `SyntaxError: Unexpected token x in JSON`. *Fix submitted by Jignesh Baldha in pull request [15347](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15347)*. [GitHub-15037](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15037)

<!-- ENGCOM-1463  -->

*  Disabling a product now removes it from the flat index as expected. *Fix submitted by Mr. Lewis in pull request [15019](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15019)*. [GitHub-14966](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14966)

<!-- ENGCOM-1051  -->

*  The success message that Magento displays when a customer adds a product to the compare list now contains a link to the comparison list. *Fix submitted by Andreas von Studnitz in pull request [13862](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/13862)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-1953  -->

*  Cache problems no longer occur when currencies are used without a currency symbol. *Fix submitted by Dmytro Cheshun in pull request [15902](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15902)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-1927  -->

*  Catalog component blocks now contain correct return type suggestions, and typos have been corrected where needed in the PHPDocs. *Fix submitted by Dmytro Cheshun in pull request [15913](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15913)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-1287  -->

*  Widget cache errors that resulted in one widget being loaded twice on the storefront have been resolved. *Fix submitted by Alexandr Kozyr in pull request [12764](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/12764)*. [GitHub-4389](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/4389)

<!-- ENGCOM-1059  -->

*  Magento no longer makes redundant requests on the 'customer data' on the checkout  page. *Fix submitted by Andrey Bezyazychnyy in pull request [14314](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/14314)*. [GitHub-13765](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13765)

<!-- MAGETWO-93196  -->

*  Administrators with permission to change product names on one website only cannot change product names on any other sites. Previously, an administrator with permission to change a product name on one site only could change product names on all websites in a multisite deployment.

<!-- MAGETWO-93103  -->

*  Administrators with limited privileges can now save products as expected.

<!-- MAGETWO-93071  -->

*  Magento now uses the current date as expected when setting the start date for a special price. Previously, Magento set the start date for a special price a few years in the future, which prevented the special price for being active.

<!-- MAGETWO-92907  -->

*  Magento now reliably displays category images on the custom store view level.  Previously, the category image on custom store view level alternately disappeared and appeared after every save operation.

<!-- MAGETWO-92574  -->

*  Magento no longer removes downloadable product links after an attribute is updated.

<!-- MAGETWO-92502  -->

*  Extra POST requests are no longer sent if the  **Synchronize widget products with backend storage** option is set to **yes**.

<!-- MAGETWO-92389  -->

*  You can now create a product date attribute that contains a day value than exceeds 12 (in the format dd/mm/yyyy). Previously, when you created a product attribute with a default date specifying a day greater than 12, Magento did not save the attribute, but instead displayed this error, `Invalid default date`.

<!-- MAGETWO-91402  -->

*  You can now use the `Magento\Catalog\Model\ProductRepository` class to assign a product to one website as expected. Previously, using this class to save a product assigned the product to all existing websites, not just the specified one.

<!-- MAGETWO-91163  -->

*  Images now load as expected on the product display page (PDP) when the image name contains double quotation marks.

<!-- MAGETWO-90940  -->

*  The SEO-friendly URL for the Category page now works as expected.

<!-- MAGETWO-90768  -->

*  The **Use Default Value** checkboxes in the design section of the category page are now enabled by default as expected.

<!-- MAGETWO-92280  -->

*  Customers can now use the **Add Product By SKU** button to add configurable products to a sales order.

<!-- MAGETWO-90569  -->

*  Empty dropdown or swatch type product attributes are no longer visible on the product page.

<!-- MAGETWO-90367  -->

*  Attributes that have empty values across all products being compared are not displayed as rows in the comparison table. Previously, Magento displayed these attributes  with an N/A value on the  Compare Products page.

<!-- MAGETWO-89732  -->

*  The Catalog page now displays breadcrumbs as expected.

<!-- MAGETWO-88504  -->

*  Tiered pricing and quantity increments now work as expected with decimal-based inventories.

<!-- MAGETWO-88102  -->

*  Magento now updates the `catalog_category_product_index` table as expected after a category is deleted.

<!-- MAGETWO-87721  -->

*  Customizable options are now configured the same for all websites to which a product is added. Previously, when a merchant added a product with customizable options to an additional site, the options were corrupted.

<!-- MAGETWO-87589  -->

*  The **Use default value** option is no longer unchecked unless the user overrides the value of the attribute in the store view scope. Previously, after creating an item, if the user changed to store view scope and did not make any modifications to the item's attributes and only clicked **Save**, most of the attributes that were set as **Use default value** became unchecked.

<!-- MAGETWO-87430  -->

*  Category product indexer logic has been optimized, and re-indexing time has been noticeably reduced.  Previously, when you had many categories (100,000), Magento could take up to 40 minutes to re-index product catalogs.

<!-- MAGETWO-86710  -->

*  Widget selection by Enabled Products no longer causes a fatal error on a storefront when the **Flat Product** is configured.

<!-- MAGETWO-86295  -->

*  Merchants can now change the `status` and `update` attributes from the product page. Previously, Magento returned a 404 page when bulk enabling or disabling products in the Admin with a restricted user role that is limited to a specific website.

<!-- MAGETWO-85682  -->

*  Magento now maintains the default setting for a product's `status` attribute when you create a new product. Previously, when creating a new product after changing the default option from Enabled to Disabled for this attribute, the status is incorrectly set to enabled by default.

<!-- MAGETWO-84891  -->

*  The print preview of product comparison results (that is, the page of results that Magento produces when you click **Compare** after selecting two or more products) now displays as expected. Previously, only a subset of page elements was displayed.

<!-- MAGETWO-82116  -->

*  Magento now maintains the correct dates in the results of filtering the Admin Product Grid Filter: Set Product as New from Date. [GitHub-11517](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11517)

<!-- MAGETWO-75427  -->

*  As you type additional characters into the text field for a product's custom option, the hint showing the number of characters left before reaching the maximum now decreases as expected.

<!-- MAGETWO-60573  -->

*  Merchants can now set custom option fixed prices with  negative values in the Admin. [GitHub-7333](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/7333)

<!-- MAGETWO-73739  -->

*  You can now unset a category image on the store-view level when the image is defined on all store views.

<!-- MAGETWO-74021  -->

*  The Catalog Products List widget can now display products on the storefront that have specific attributes.

<!--  ENGCOM-2383  -->

*  The shopping cart now correctly displays images of configurable products that have only size options (that is, no color options). Previously, when a customer added a configurable product that had only size options to her shopping cart, the shopping cart did not display the expected product image. *Fix submitted by Ronak Patel in pull request [16863](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16863)*. [GitHub-16843](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/16843)

<!--  ENGCOM-2313  -->

*  Magento now throws an exception as expected  when a user tries to submit a product review without selecting a star rating. Previously, if a user submitted a product review without selecting a star rating, Magento assigned a one-star rating.

<!--  ENGCOM-2213  -->

*  Magento now successfully displays product prices in currencies without minor units if the price amount is less then the number group size.  [GitHub-11711](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11711)

<!-- ENGCOM-2193  -->

*  Magento now displays the correct  price on the product page for storefronts running Japanese locales. *Fix submitted by Vishal Gelani in pull request [15909](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15909)*. [GitHub-11711](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11711)

<!-- ENGCOM-1106  -->

*  Magento now correctly saves the value of a product's custom options. Previously, Magento saved all objects by using the same value object for all values. *Fix submitted by Jeroen Van Leusden in pull request [13569](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/13569)*. [GitHub-5067](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/5067)

<!-- ENGCOM-1911  -->

*  Magento now displays the product name as browser title as expected. Previously, the meta title tag was missing, which prevented Magento from displaying the product name. *Fix submitted by Riccardo Tempesta in pull request [15532](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15532)*. [GitHub-15501](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15501)

<!-- ENGCOM-2042  -->

*  Magento now maintains the default products sort order of “newest first” when you upgrade your Magento deployment to 2.2.4. Previously, after upgrade, the default products order in categories changed from “newest first” to “oldest first”. *Fix submitted by Danny Verkade in pull request [15629](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15629)*. [GitHub-15627](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15627)

<!-- ENGCOM-1909 -->

*  Links on product pages are now linkable as expected. Previously, when Magento displayed a product page, none of the provided links were clickable. *Fix submitted by simonjanguapa in pull request [15687](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15687)*. [GitHub-15393](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15393)

<!-- ENGCOM-2408 -->

*  Deprecated methods in Message Manager have been replaced with valid methods. *Fix submitted by Tiago Sampaio in pull request [16924](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16924)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-2390 -->

*  Array short syntax usage has been standardized in these files: `app/code/Magento/Catalog/Test/Unit/Model/ProductTest.php`, `app/code/Magento/GroupedProduct/Test/Unit/Model/ProductTest.php`, and `setup/src/Magento/Setup/Module/Di/Code/Reader/FileScanner.php`. *Fix submitted by Leandro F. L. in pull request [16880](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16880)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-2132 -->

<!-- ENGCOM-2188  -->

*  When two simple products of a configurable product have different prices, Magento now uses the lowest price as the default price on the product detail page. Previously, if one of the simple products had price=0, Magento did not use it as the default. *Fix submitted by Torrey Tsui in pull request [16540](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16540)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-1512  -->

<!--  ENGCOM-1432  -->

### EAV

<!-- MAGETWO- 90576 -->

<!-- MAGETWO-73062 -->

*  Magento now displays the fixed product tax attribute label as expected according to the specified store view.

<!-- MAGETWO-90576 -->

*  You can now successfully save a product after setting its special requirements  multiselect attribute. (This means that attribute values are saved as expected to the database, checked in `_catalog_product_entity_varchar_ table`,  and displayed as non-selected on product page in the Admin.)

<!--  ENGCOM-1981  -->

<!--  ENGCOM-1374  -->

[GitHub-5768](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/5768)

<!--  ENGCOM-1356  -->

Previously, this password reset email was sent from the default store. *Fix submitted by Rodrigo Mourão in pull request [14800](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/14800)*. [GitHub-5726](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/5726)

<!-- MAGETWO-91164  -->

*  The `catalog:image:resize` command execution time has been reduced by up to 90% in the release. However, this improvement necessitates these additional steps after upgrading your Magento instance to 2.2.6:

   *  Remove   `pub/media/catalog/product/cache`. (Removing this folder frees up space.)

   *  Run `bin/magento catalog:image:resize`  to generate a new image cache.  (This step is necessary because we’ve changed the path to cached images and must remove the previously cached images.)

<!-- MAGETWO-87731  -->

*  We've fixed a display error that occurred when both a Critical Admin Notification and Release Notification window were opened.

<!--  ENGCOM-2416  -->

*  Changes that were made to file permissions for  `lib/internal/Magento/Framework/View/Asset/Merged.php` and its associated test that were made in an earlier release have been reverted. *Fix submitted by Ihor Sviziev in pull request [16937](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16937)*.

#### Application framework

<!-- MAGETWO-92722  -->

#### JavaScript framework

<!--  ENGCOM-1677  -->

*  `lib/web/mage/dropdowns.js` no longer fails when autoclose is set to **true**. *Fix submitted by Brian LaBelle in pull request [15499](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15499)*. [GitHub-15469](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15469)

<!-- MAGETWO-90193  -->

Previously, when you created a token for an Admin user and have set   **Admin Token Lifetime (hours))**  to empty, Magento denied access  because the token immediately expired. *Fix submitted by Maikel Martens in pull request [15598](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15598)*. [GitHub-15564](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15564)

*  `catalogProductAttributeRepository` now returns the `frontend_labels` value as expected.

#### Cache framework

<!-- MAGETWO-69847  -->

See "Redis and static-content deployment" in [Redis troubleshooting]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/trouble/redis-troubleshooting.html) for more information. [GitHub-9287](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9287)

<!-- MAGETWO-84109  -->

*  When a layout is loaded from the cache, Magento now repopulates the list of applied layout handles to prevent any chance of a layout handle being reapplied later. *Fix submitted by Scott Buchanan in pull request [12314](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/12314)*.

### Dashboard

<!-- MAGETWO-91411  -->

*  Magento no longer sends duplicate delete requests as a result of an unstable Internet connection. Previously, unintentional mass deletion of products sometimes occurred as a result of an unstable Internet connection.

<!-- MAGETWO-91928  -->

*  You can now successfully save a product video for one store view in deployments that have several store views. Previously, when you saved a product video for one store view, Magento saved it for all store views, although customers could play the video on the original store only.

<!-- MAGETWO-91931  -->

*  Customer data is now fully loaded after restarting the browser during an unexpired user session. Previously,  the `section_data_ids` section of the session cookie was not properly completed. [GitHub-14912](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14912)

<!-- MAGETWO-91000  -->

### Gift cards

<!-- MAGETWO-92988  -->

*  Magento now displays the **Credit Memo** link  at the top of the page for orders with a total of 0 (zero). Previously, this link was missing, which prevented users from creating a credit memo for the order.

<!-- MAGETWO-92362  -->

*  You can now save gift cards without the price being changed on the Admin to an unacceptable format. Previously, Magento tried to save amounts in unacceptable formats (such as the inclusion of a comma in a four-digit price), which triggered an error.

<!-- MAGETWO-91925  -->

*  Magento no longer permits users to save a new gift card  without first completing the required values. Previously, when creating a gift card, users could save the card without having designated an amount, but the card could not be purchased. Magento also created a `report.CRITICAL: Warning` error message in the `system.log`.

<!-- MAGETWO- 91867 -->

*  Orders now retain gift message information on both item and order level. Previously, gift messages disappeared from an order when a customer logged into his account during checkout.

<!-- MAGETWO-91576  -->

*  Magento now maintains relationships between new gift card accounts when a customer purchases several gift cards in the same order.

<!-- MAGETWO-91400  -->

*  Magento now refunds only the exact amount used on a gift card if only the part of the gift card was  used. Previously, when a customer used a gift card account code to partially pay for an order,  and Magento subsequently created a credit memo for a portion of the order, the full amount of the gift card was refunded.

<!-- MAGETWO-86757  -->

*  Magento now generates the same number of gift card codes when the full order is invoiced as the customer selected when creating an order. Previously, for orders that included both physical products and multiple gift cards, the number of gift card codes  generated on an order corresponded to the quantity of the previous physical line items that the user had added to the cart before adding gift cards.

### Gift message

<!-- MAGETWO-91867  -->

*  Orders now retain gift message information on both item and order level. Previously, gift messages disappeared from an order when a customer logged into his account during checkout.

### Google Analytics

### Google Tag Manager

<!-- MAGETWO-91951  -->

*  The `addToCart` event triggers on the Google Task Manager console only when an item is added to the cart.  Previously, the event was triggered before the cart was updated.

<!-- MAGETWO-89532  -->

*  Google Analytics events are now triggered as expected. Specifically,  the  `addToCart` and `removeFromCart` events are not triggered until after a customer adds a product to the mini cart.

<!-- MAGETWO-87955  -->

*  Magento now accurately updates the mini cart when a customer removes a product while accessing a storefront using Internet Explorer 11.x. Previously, when a customer removed a product from the mini cart, Magento did not remove the product but instead threw this error, `(SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'find'. File: sidebar.js, Line: 237, Column: 13 )`.

<!-- MAGETWO-88806  -->

*  Google Tag Manager product category data is now fully reported. Previously, the Google Tag Manager product category (Enhanced Ecommerce) data did not report all information.

### HTML

<!-- ENGCOM-2178  -->

*  Responsive table headers now work as expected. Previously, when no heading was present in the `data-th` attribute on a column for a responsive table in Magento, only a colon was present. *Fix submitted by Sean Templeton in pull request [16517](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16517)*.

### Infrastructure

<!-- MAGETWO-89442  -->

*  Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) calls now return order items and comments as expected.

<!-- MAGETWO-92302  -->

*  The RMA status label now shows on the email that Magento sends to customers when the status of an RMA changes.

<!-- MAGETWO-72090  -->

*  Magento now deselects only the attributes you choose to deselect when you set the **Use Default Value** setting on a store view to **no** for certain attributes. Previously, when you deselected the **Use Default Value** setting on a store view for certain attributes, Magento unselected other attributes as well.

<!-- MAGETWO-88615  -->

*  You can now cancel an order that was placed with Braintree when the Braintree authorization had expired.

<!-- MAGETWO-84929  -->

Previously, when a merchant tried to enable more than one payment method from the Admin, Magento displayed this error in the console, `Found elements with non-unique id billing-address-form`. *Fix submitted by Neeta Kangiya in pull request [15349](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15349)*.

### Pagecache

<!-- MAGETWO-92757  -->

*  Full-page cache now works as expected in multistore deployments. Previously, when you opened the URL of a non-default store in a multistore deployment, full-page cache did not return the URL.

### Performance

<!-- MAGETWO-47320  -->

<!-- MAGETWO-86143  -->

*  Merchants can now improve store performance by disabling Magento Report functionality if business function does not require this capability. A new configuration setting  (**System Configuration**: **General** > **Reports** > **General Options**) allows merchants to disable Magento Reports, which is recommended practice  if a merchant's business function does not require this capability.

<!-- MAGETWO-92154  -->

*  You can change store locale without the exporting and importing configuration process. While Magento is in Production and the `SCD_ON_DEMAND` is enabled, the Magento store and admin locale options are available. See [Change locales]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/live/sens-data-over.html#change-locales).

<!-- MAGETWO-90572  -->

*  The time required to load category or product pages for products that are configured with many attributes (more than 500) has been significantly reduced. Refactoring the logic for product attribute retrieval has resulted in a reduction of load time of almost 90% for certain scenarios.

<!-- MAGETWO-88670  -->

*  The time required to load a store’s home page has been reduced noticeably when the top menu contains many categories.  (Load time is still affected by the number of categories and the structure of the top menu.)

<!-- ENGCOM-1294 -->

*  The speed of catalog price rule save operations has been improved by these changes:

   *  elimination of unnecessary reindexing

   *  improvement to the way that the `getMatchingProductIds` function fetches products, which has eliminated unnecessary checks of the data set. *Fix submitted by Andrey Zabara in pull request [14707](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/14707)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-1302 -->

*  The ID to SKU lookup process for tier prices has been optimized. Previously, with a large number of tier or group prices, each tier would separately make a database query to look up the associated SKU. *Fix submitted by Todd Christensen in pull request [14699](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/14699)*.

### Product video

<!-- MAGETWO-93792  -->

*  Magento now populates the YouTube video URL and Title fields with the same values as are populated on the default store view on multisite deployments. (These fields are global scope attributes and should be the same on all storefronts.) Previously, Magento left these fields blank in multisite deployments.

### Quote

<!-- ENGCOM-1414  -->

*  Magento now displays the correct product price for an order created from the Admin in multisite deployments. Previously, when an order was created from the Admin in a multisite deployment where products were assigned different prices per store view, Magento defaulted to the product price of the primary storeview if the order was edited or updated. *Fix submitted by Riccardo Tempesta in pull request [14904](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/14904)*. [GitHub-14869](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14869)

<!-- ENGCOM-1441  -->

*  Magento now successfully saves the value of `REMOTE_IP` when a customer uses an IPV6 (Internet Protocol version 6) address. Previously, this value was only partially saved in the `sales_order` and `quote` tables.  *Fix submitted by George Schiopu in pull request [14976](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/14976)*. [GitHub-10395](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10395)

<!-- ENGCOM-1885  -->

*  Coupon codes now work for guest users through the web API as well as from the storefront. *Fix submitted by Marcin Dykas in pull request [15320](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15320)*. [GitHub-14056](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14056)

<!-- ENGCOM-2254  -->

*  Magento no longer runs an SQL query on every item in the database when a quote is empty, which has improved the performance of the checkout process. *Fix submitted by Sean Templeton in pull request [16675](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16675)*.

### Reports

<!-- ENGCOM-2215  -->

*  The timezone has been removed from the date when Magento retrieves the current month from a UTC timestamp. *Fix submitted by Prince Patel in pull request [16584](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16584)*. [GitHub-15940](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15940)

### Review

<!-- ENGCOM-1535  -->

*  Removed the unused class declaration from controller's index action and the unused code in the comment block from the template file in `app/code/Magento/Review/view/frontend/templates/redirect.phtml` and `app/code/Magento/Version/Controller/Index/Index.php`. *Fix submitted by Yogesh Suhagiya in pull request [15173](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15173)*.

### Rule

<!-- MAGETWO-89220  -->

*  A cart rule that uses  a `subselection` condition now works as executed. Previously, cart rules with this condition automatically granted a discount.

<!-- ENGCOM-1961  -->

*  The retrieval of first array elements in the following files has been improved: `app/code/Magento/Rule/Model/Action/AbstractAction.php` and `app/code/Magento/Rule/Model/Condition/Combine.php`. *Fix submitted by Thomas Klein in pull request [16053](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16053)*. [GitHub-15940](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15940)

<!-- ENGCOM-1583  -->

*  The condition category chooser now handles multiple nested categories as expected. Previously,  if a cart rule contained several nested categories, no categories appeared on the page, the page  became unresponsive,  and  eventually crashed. *Fix submitted by Keith Bentrup in pull request [15265](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15265)*. [GitHub-15121](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15121)

### Sales

<!-- MAGETWO-93102  -->

*  Order status now remains in the Complete state after Magento refunds store credit on a partial credit memo. Previously, under these circumstances, Magento changed the status of the order to Closed.

<!-- MAGETWO-92847  -->

*  You can now create multiple credit memos in one session and save each successfully. Previously, Magento displayed this error when you tried to save a second credit memo after creating the first memo: `Could not save credit memo`.

<!-- MAGETWO-92899  -->

*  Magento now displays any errors that occur during order creation in the browser console. Previously, Magento displayed this message: `Uncaught ReferenceError: order is not defined during order creation` instead of a specific error message.

<!-- MAGETWO-91466  -->

*  The `POST /V1/shipment` endpoint processes `tracks` arrays as expected.

<!-- MAGETWO-90496  -->

*  Magento no longer reverts to the country associated with the default website when a customer edits the billing address for an order. Previously, if a customer edited the shipping address for an order, Magento would reset the billing address to the default address specified for the default website.

<!-- ENGCOM-2148  -->

*  Credit memo email template file incorrect object types have been corrected. Previously, when a merchant created a credit memo and checked the **Email** checkbox, Magento threw an error. *Fix submitted by Joseph Maxwell in pull request [16438](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16438)*.

<!-- MAGETWO-89238  -->

*  Performance issues that resulted from disabling invoice emails have been resolved.

<!-- ENGCOM-2085  -->

<!-- ENGCOM-1892  -->

*  You can now set the `is_visible_on_front` parameter from the `addStatusHistoryComment` of the order mode. Previously, you could set the `is_visible_on_front` parameter  from the Admin only. *Fix submitted by Mark Shust in pull request [15637](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15637)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-2024  -->

<!-- ENGCOM-1529  -->

*  The `addFieldToFilter` has been added to `addressCollection` in  `app/code/Magento/Sales/Setup/UpgradeData.php`, which optimizes the process of collecting addresses during upgrade. *Fix submitted by Dmytro Cheshun in pull request [15615](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15615)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-1623  -->

*  Invoice prefixes now contain the correct store ID when Magento is deployed in a multistore environment. Previously, Magento always created the invoice number using the default store view ID. *Fix submitted by Sanjay Patel in pull request [15615](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15615)*. [GitHub-14063](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14063)

<!-- ENGCOM-1531  -->

*  The `GET /V1/orders/items/{id}` request now returns `parent_item`. *Fix submitted by Sanjay Patel in pull request [15615](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15615)*.

### Sales rules

<!-- MAGETWO-91797  -->

*  Cart price rules with associated coupons are no longer affected by edits to scheduled updates.

<!-- ENGCOM-2122  -->

*  The  `discount` label in the `app/code/Magento/SalesRule/view/frontend/web/js/view/summary/discount.js` file is now compatible with custom module discount.  *Fix submitted by Rodrigo Santellan in pull request [16093](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16093)*.

### Search

<!-- ENGCOM-1381  -->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when a customer uses quick search to search on a term that does not exist in the search database. Previously, Magento returned this error, `TypeError: this._getFirstVisibleElement(...).addClass is not a function`. *Fix submitted by Julien ANQUETIL in pull request [14839](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/14839)*. [GitHub-14274](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14274)

<!-- ENGCOM-1616  -->

*  Customers can now use the **Enter** key to submit searches from a page header. Previously, when a customer used the **Enter** key to submit a search query, event handlers that were bound to the form submit (through jQuery) were fired twice. *Fix submitted by Amjad M in pull request [15340](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15340)*. [GitHub-13793](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13793)

<!-- ENGCOM-1887  -->

*  Swagger now handles `searchCriteria`-related requests as expected. *Fix submitted by Jakub in pull request [15040](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15040)*. [GitHub-15322](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15322)

<!--  MAGETWO-85786  -->

*  The Admin panel search now filters catalogs as expected. Previously, if a merchant tried to narrow a search when using the Search tool in the Admin panel, Magento displayed the full catalog view without narrowing down the list. *Fix submitted by Pavel in pull request [12735](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/12735)*. [GitHub-7861](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/7861)

<!--  ENGCOM-1415  -->

*  You can now use an asterix when searching on customer names. Previously, if you used an asterix in a search query, Magento displayed this message, `Something went wrong with processing the default view and we have restored the filter to its original state.` *Fix submitted by Riccardo Tempesta  in pull request [14905](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/14905)*. [GitHub-14855](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14855)

[GitHub-8131](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8131)

<!-- ENGCOM-2245  -->

*  Server load has been reduced for advanced searching.  Previously, when a customer entered text in the search suggestion box, Magento immediately sent every character to the server. The auto-complete box now delays  sending the request. *Fix submitted by Sean Templeton in pull request [16669](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16669)*.

<!-- ENGCOM-1672  -->

*  You can now successfully clone the minisearch widget. *Fix submitted by Daniel Ruf in pull request [15485](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15485)*.

### Shipping

<!--  ENGCOM-2033  -->

<!--  ENGCOM-1675  -->

*  A method with a misspelled name was deprecated and the new method with correct spelling added to `app/code/Magento/Multishipping/Block/Checkout/AbstractMultishipping.php`. *Fix submitted by Anna Völkl in pull request [15514](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15514)*.

### Store

<!--  ENGCOM-1706  -->

*  Magento now adds the correct store code to product URLs in stores with more than one store view when  **Stores** > **Settings** > **Configuration** > **General** > **Web** > **Add Store Code to Urls** is set to **yes**. *Fix submitted by Elias Kotlyar in pull request [15566](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15566)*.

#### Elasticsearch

<!-- MAGETWO-92142  -->

*  Bundle products are now indexed as expected in Elasticsearch.

<!-- MAGETWO-86153  -->

*  Elasticsearch now correctly calculates the relevance of quick search results according to selected attribute search weights.

#### Admin global search

<!-- MAGETWO-86658  -->

*  Admin global search preview now works as expected. Previously, this feature worked inconsistently, and search results  differed depending on which area was being searched  (for example, Products, Categories, or Customers).

<!-- MAGETWO-86289  -->

*  The Admin global search now returns results that match the keyword for all available pages, or if a user searches in  specific sections, the search feature now returns only the results that matched the key words in those specific sections. Previously, the Admin global search did not return results that matched the specified keywords and did not restrict results to specified sections.

<!-- MAGETWO-85786  -->

*  Catalogs are now correctly filtered by the Admin search bar. Previously, if you attempted to use the Search tool in the Admin, and selected "XX in Products", Magento displayed the full catalog view without narrowing down the list. *Fix submitted by Pavel in pull request 12735*.

### Shipping

<div class="bs-callout-info" id="info" markdown="1">

<!-- MAGETWO-91035  -->

### Sitemap

<!-- MAGETWO-92781  -->

*  Sitemaps generated by `cron` no longer display  `/pub/` in image URLs when  `docroot` is set to `/pub`. Previously, if the `docroot` was set to `pub` and `BASE MEDIA URL` was not set, the cron-generated sitemap  generated incorrect image URLs.

<!-- ENGCOM-1073  -->

*  Magento now generates correct product URLs for sitemaps. Previously, when the **Use Categories Path for Product URLs** attribute was set to **no**  in **Configuration** >  **Catalog** > **Search Engine Optimization**, Magento generated the wrong product URL in the sitemap.

<!-- ENGCOM-1866  -->

*  Images in XML sitemap are no longer always linked to the primary store in a multistore deployment. *Fix submitted by Steven de Jong in pull request [15689](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15689)*. [GitHub-15588](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15588)

<!-- ENGCOM-1377  -->

*  Split sitemaps now use the index sitemap name as a prefix. Previously, when generating large sitemaps that result in a single index sitemap and several smaller split sitemap files, the split sitemap files did not use the same name prefix as the parent. *Fix submitted by James Halsall in pull request [14836](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/14836)*.

### Store

<!--  ENGCOM-2530  -->

*  The `getUrlInStore()` method no longer returns URLs that contain the store code, which has shortened the extremely long URLs it previously returned. *Fix submitted by Burlacu Vasilii in pull request [16468](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16468)*. [GitHub-16273](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/16273)

### Swatches

<!--  ENGCOM-1443 -->

*  The process of switching attribute input type has been fixed, which resolves multiple issues that customers were experiencing when working with swatches, including:

   *  inability to change attribute types from `swatch` to `dropdown`

   *  inability to remove swatches from existing products when changing an attribute type from `swatch`

   *  no updates to product attributes on the storefront. *Fix submitted by Eugene Shab in pull request [12771](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/12771)*. [GitHub-9307](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9307), [GitHub-11403](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11403), [GitHub-11703](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11703), [GitHub-12695](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12695)

<!--  ENGCOM-2386  -->

*  The `Invalid country code` error message that sometimes occurred during import of tax CSV files now includes the name of the country whose data is causing the error. Previously, the message did not identify which country's data caused the error. *Fix submitted by Adam Moss in pull request [16873](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16873)*.

### Testing

### Theme

<!--  ENGCOM-1516  -->

*  Merchants can now successfully change the applied theme. Previously, Magento displayed an error when a merchant tried to save changes to the applied theme on **Content** > **Design** > **Configuration**. *Fix submitted by Daniel Ruf in pull request [15137](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/15137)*.

### Translation

<!-- MAGETWO-92210  -->

*  The `translation.json` file now contains translatable strings for the phrases "Store Credit" and "Gift Card". Previously, these strings were not translated for the shopping cart, one-page checkout, or order view in the customer account on the storefront.

<!-- MAGETWO-92355  -->

*  We've added  client-side caching of `js-translation.js`.

<!-- ENGCOM-1965  -->

## Known issues

**Issue**: Merchants cannot save a newly created multiselect or dropdown customer attribute or edit existing customer attributes from the customer’s account on the storefront after upgrade to Magento 2.2.6.

**Workaround**: Download and apply hot fix [MAGETWO-95591](https://magento.com/tech-resources/download#download2248). This issue will be fixed in Magento Open Source 2.2.7, which is scheduled for release by the end of 2018.

**Issue**: The `catalog:image:resize` command execution time has been reduced by up to 90% in the release. However, this improvement necessitates these additional steps after upgrading your Magento instance to 2.2.6:

*  Remove   `pub/media/catalog/product/cache`. The path for cached images was changed in this release, which explains why you need to clean this directory after upgrade to free up space.

*  Run `bin/magento catalog:image:resize`  to generate a new image cache.  This step is necessary because we’ve changed the path to cached images and must remove the previously cached images.
