We are pleased to present Magento Commerce 2.2.3.

For security reasons, this release limits the ability to use symlinks for `/media` and other folders. If you are using symlinks for deployment, or if your `/media` is using symlinks, you may experience problems uploading or removing images. Magento will announce a fix for this issue when available. See [GitHub-13929](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13929){:target="_blank"} for more information.

## Highlights

Look for the following highlights in this release:

*  **Enhancements that help close cross-site request forgery (CSRF), unauthorized data leaks, and authenticated Admin user remote code execution vulnerabilities**. See [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-223-2112-and-2018-security-update) for more information.

*  **Support for Elasticsearch 5.x**. See [Install and configure Elasticsearch]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/v2.2/config-guide/elasticsearch/es-overview.html) for more information about using Elasticsearch with Magento. *Fix submitted by community member <a href="https://github.com/afoucret" target="_blank">Aurélien Foucret</a>.*

*  **Change to Magento Admin to support recent USPS shipping changes**. On February 23, 2018, USPS  removed APIs that support the creation of shipping labels without postage. In response, we’ve removed this functionality from the Magento Admin. Consequently, you cannot create and print shipping labels that do not have postage applied. If you require USPS postage printing capabilities, please visit [Magento Shipping](https://magento.com/products/shipping) to learn more, and explore various shipping extensions on Magento Marketplace.

*  **New layers of control for cache management tasks managed through the Magento Admin**. This release introduces finer permissions for cache management tasks such as flushing cache storage, flushing the Magento cache, and refreshing cache types. *Fix submitted by community member <a href="https://github.com/bartoszherba" target="_blank">Bartosz Herba</a>.*

*  **Updated copyright to 2018**.

## Security enhancements

Magento 2.2.3 includes multiple security enhancements. Although this release includes these enhancements, no confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions, so we recommend that you upgrade your Magento software to the latest version as soon as possible.

See [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-223-2112-and-2018-security-update) for more information.
