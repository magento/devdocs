## Overview

The `Magento_NegotiableQuote` module allows a customer and a merchant (admin user) to negotiate product and/or shipping prices before the customer places an order. Its functionality is available for the company members only.

Currently, B2B quoting is global--the price is given for the quote as a whole. Quoting per item is not supported. The quote lifecycle is managed via quote statuses. The quoting interface allows both a merchant and a customer to manage items in the quote (add, delete, change quantity) as well as make an offer (or request a quote) for items and/or for shipping. The negotiated price set in the negotiable quote is exactly the price that will be applied on a quote during checkout, order generation, and invoice generation.

The module provides a set of configurations for the quoting feature, such as the ability to request a quote, configure the minimum quote amount, configure the default expiration period, configure attached files, and set email templates for quotes. The module provides web APIs and can be integrated with 3rd party solutions to manage negotiable quote in Magento.

## Installation details

The module heavily depends on the `Quote` and `Magento_Company` modules, which must be previously installed and enabled.

Also, the module has dependency on the following Magentoâ€™s B2C modules: `Tax`, `Checkout`, and `CartPricingRules` modules.

When working with the `SharedCatalog` module, `NegotiableQuote` will be restricted to the products added to the shared catalog and custom prices set in the shared catalog.

The module does not create any backward incompatible changes. Can be deactivated and uninstalled at any time.
