Previous step

[Prepare for local environment setup]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/before/before-workspace.html)

To begin working with a project and develop your store, you should have received an e-mail invitation to [create a Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition account](https://accounts.magento.cloud). The account provides access to your project for Magento development and deployment across all supported environments.

You should receive an e-mail invitation to verify and access the account. If you do not see the invitation, check your junk e-mail folder. Click the **Verify my account** option in the email to verify and access your account.

When logged in, you should see a project named and ready to access.

{:.bs-callout-info}
We recommend always starting with the blank site from a template as your initial project option. Completely deploy this code across your entire environment from Integration to Staging to Production for a clear experience with deployment in {{site.data.var.ece}}. If you have an existing Magento deployment, import code, extensions, themes, and data after fully deploying this base Magento code.
