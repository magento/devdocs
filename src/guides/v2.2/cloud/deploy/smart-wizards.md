The smart wizards can help you determine whether your Cloud configuration follows best practices. The available wizards assist with the following configurations:

-  Ideal state for minimal deployment downtime
-  Load balancing configuration for database and Redis
-  Static Content Deployment (SCD) for on-demand, the build stage, or the deploy stage

Each of the smart wizard commands provides a verification response and, if applicable, a recommendation for the proper configuration.

Command | Description
------- | -----------
`wizard:ideal-state` | Check that SCD is on the _build_ stage, the `SKIP_HTML_MINIFICATION` variable is `true`, and the post_deploy hook configured in the Cloud environment. Not for use in the local development environment.
`wizard:master-slave` | Check that the `REDIS_USE_SLAVE_CONNECTION` variable and the `MYSQL_USE_SLAVE_CONNECTION` variable is `true`.
`wizard:scd-on-demand` | Check that the `SCD_ON_DEMAND` global environment variable is `true`.
`wizard:scd-on-build` | Check that the `SCD_ON_DEMAND` global environment variable is `false` and the `SKIP_SCD` environment variable is `false` for the _build_ stage. Verifies that the `config.php` file contains information for stores, store groups, and websites.
`wizard:scd-on-deploy` | Check that the `SCD_ON_DEMAND` global environment variable is `false` and the `SKIP_SCD` environment variable is `false` for the _deploy_ stage. Verifies that the `config.php` file does _NOT_ contain the list of stores, store groups, and websites with related information.

As an example, you can verify that your configuration properly enables the SCD on-demand feature:

```bash
./vendor/bin/ece-tools wizard:scd-on-demand
```

A successful configuration returns:

```terminal
SCD on-demand is enabled
```
{: .no-copy}

A failed configuration returns:

```terminal
SCD on-demand is disabled
```
{: .no-copy}

## Verifying an ideal configuration

The _ideal_ configuration for your Cloud project helps to minimize deployment downtime by warming the cache and generating static content when requested by the user. This wizard automatically runs during the deployment process. If your Cloud is not configured for this _ideal state_, then you receive a message similar to the following:

```terminal
- SCD on build is not configured
- Post-deploy hook is not configured
- Skip HTML minification is disabled

Ideal state is not configured
```
{: .no-copy}

Based on the output, you need to make the following corrections to your configuration:

1. Enable the Skip HTML minification variable.

   > .magento.env.yaml

   ```yaml
   stage:
     global:
       SKIP_HTML_MINIFICATION: true
   ```

1. Configure the post-deploy hook.

   > .magento.app.yaml

   ```yaml
       post_deploy: |
           php ./vendor/bin/ece-tools post-deploy
   ```

1. Push your code changes and run the test again. When your configuration is _ideal_, you receive the following message.

   ```terminal
   Ideal state is configured
   ```
   {: .no-copy}
