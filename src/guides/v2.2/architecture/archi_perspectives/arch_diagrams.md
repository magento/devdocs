## Magento architecture from different perspectives  {#m2arch-whatis-overview}

Depending upon your role and purpose for learning more about Magento, there are several different ways to view the Magento architecture. For example, a developer who wants to create new modules or perhaps customize an existing [module](https://glossary.magento.com/module) will want to understand the architecture of a module itself, and how it fits into the larger view, with the Magento framework and other components. However, a merchant who wants to quickly build an online storefront wants to view the collection of components from a higher level, and understand the components that impact the look, feel, and user interaction components.

## Architecture layers diagram {#archi-layers}

The following diagram illustrates the components and shows the "layers" or tiers in Magento.
