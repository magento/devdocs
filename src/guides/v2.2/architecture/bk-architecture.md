The Architecture Guide provides a high-level introduction and view of the Magento product.

The Magento platform and components are explained from the perspective of several audiences: merchants, web store developers (frontend developers), [extension](https://glossary.magento.com/extension) developers, system admins, installers, and integrators.

More detailed information about building online stores, using the Magento APIs, installing, configuring, and extending the platform is included in other books in our [Magento library]({{site.baseurl}}/index.html).
