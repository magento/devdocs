## Logging overview {#config-log-over}

Logs provide visibility into Magento system processes; for example, debugging information that assists you with understanding when an error occurred or what lead to the error.

This topic focuses on file-based logging, although Magento provides the flexibility to store logs in the database as well.

We recommend using centralized application logging for the following reasons:

*  It allows storage of logs on a server other than the application server and decreases disk I/O operations, simplifying support of the application server.

*  It makes processing of logs data more effective by using special tools without impact to a production server (for example, [logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash), [logplex](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logplex), or [fluentd](http://www.fluentd.org)).

Magento does not recommend or endorse any particular logging solution.

### Magento PSR-3 compliance

The [PSR-3 standard](https://zendframework.github.io/zend-log/psr3) defines a common [PHP](https://glossary.magento.com/php) interface for logging libraries. The main goal of PSR-3 is to allow libraries to receive a `Psr\Log\LoggerInterface` object and write logs to it in a simple and universal way.

This provides the ability for the implementation to be replaced easily without worry that such replacement may break the application code. It also guarantees a custom component will work even when the Magento log implementation is changed in a future version of the system.
