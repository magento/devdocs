Bulk API endpoints differ from other REST endpoints in that they combine multiple calls of the same type into an array and execute them as a single request. The endpoint handler splits the array into individual entities and writes them as separate messages to the message queue.

{:.bs-callout-info}
Use the `bin/magento queue:consumers:start async.operations.all` command to start the consumer that handles asynchronous and bulk API messages. Also, before using the Bulk API to process messages, you must install and configure RabbitMQ, which is the default message broker. See [RabbitMQ]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/prereq/install-rabbitmq.html).

### Routes

To call a bulk endpoint, add the prefix `/async/bulk` before the `/V1` of a synchronous endpoint route. For example:

```http
POST /async/bulk/V1/products
POST /async/bulk/V1/customers
```

Endpoint routes that contain input parameters require additional changes. For example, `PUT /V1/products/:sku/media/:entryId` contains the `:sku` and `:entryId` input parameters. The route of a bulk request cannot contain input parameters, so you must change the route so that it does not contain any. To do this, replace the colon (`:`) with `by` and change the first letter of the parameter to uppercase.

The following table provides several examples:

Synchronous route | Bulk route
--- | ---
`PUT /V1/products/:sku/media/:entryId` | `PUT async/bulk/V1/products/bySku/media/byEntryId`
`POST /V1/carts/:quoteId/items` | `POST async/bulk/V1/carts/byQuoteId/items`

GET and DELETE requests are not supported.

### Payloads

The payload of a bulk request contains an array of request bodies. For example, the minimal payload for creating four customers with `POST /async/bulk/V1/customers` would be structured as follows:

```json
[{
    "customer": {
        "email": "mshaw@example.com",
        "firstname": "Melanie Shaw",
        "lastname": "Doe"
    },
    "password": "Strong-Password"
},
{
    "customer": {
        "email": "bmartin@example.com",
        "firstname": "Bryce",
        "lastname": "Martin"
    },
    "password": "Strong-Password"
},
{
    "customer": {
        "email": "bmartin@example.com",
        "firstname": "Bryce",
        "lastname": "Martin"
    },
    "password": "Strong-Password"
},
{
    "customer": {
        "email": "tgomez@example.com",
        "firstname": "Teresa",
        "lastname": "Gomez"
    },
    "password": "Strong-Password"
}
]
```

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-tip}
The second and third requests are duplicates.

### Responses

The response contains an array that indicates whether the call successfully added each request to the message queue. Although the duplicated request to create a customer will fail, Magento added it to the message queue successfully.

```json
{
    "bulk_uuid": "799a59c0-09ca-4d60-b432-2953986c1c38",
    "request_items": [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "data_hash": null,
            "status": "accepted"
        },
        {
            "id": 1,
            "data_hash": null,
            "status": "accepted"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "data_hash": null,
            "status": "accepted"
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "data_hash": null,
            "status": "accepted"
        }
    ],
    "errors": false
}
```
