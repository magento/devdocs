The full list of software is listed in [System Requirements]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/system-requirements.html) but here are the essentials:

*  Web server for providing access to web pages - Currently, we have documented [Apache](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server){:target="_blank"} and [NGINX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx){:target="_blank"}.

*  Database management system for long-term data storage and retrieval - We support [MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/what-is-mysql.html){:target="_blank"}.

*  PHP - PHP is an open source scripting language suited for web development because it can be embedded in [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp){:target="_blank"} (the language of the web).

   For more information, see the [PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php){:target="_blank"} or the [PHP Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP){:target="_blank"}.
