## What's the difference between a module and a component?

A *module* is a type of *component*. A component can be:

*  A [module](https://glossary.magento.com/module) (code that extends Magento behavior)
*  A [theme](https://glossary.magento.com/theme) (changes the look and feel of your [Magento Admin](https://glossary.magento.com/magento-admin) or storefront)
*  [Language package](https://glossary.magento.com/language-package) (used to translate text and messages in the Magento application)
