The shared catalog configuration process includes assigning categories and products to the shared catalog. To assign these items to a shared catalog, the following conditions must be met:

*  The category structure must already be defined. You cannot create a new category to be included in a shared catalog. Use endpoints like `POST /V1/categories` to create a new category.

*  Each category must already be populated with products. You cannot add a new product to a category to be included in a shared catalog. Use endpoints like `POST /V1/products` to create a new product.

## Assign categories

The `sharedCatalogCategoryManagementV1` service is based on `catalogCategoryManagementV1`. To view a store's category structure, call `GET /V1/categories`.

{: .bs-callout-info }
Products that are defined within a category are not included when you assign a category to a shared catalog. You must add products separately.

**Service name:**

`sharedCatalogCategoryManagementV1`

**REST Endpoints:**

```terminal
POST /V1/sharedCatalog/:id/assignCategories
POST /V1/sharedCatalog/:id/unassignCategories
GET  /V1/sharedCatalog/:id/categories
```

**Category parameters:**

{: .bs-callout-info }
Although you can specify other parameters defined within a `categories` object, the `id` is the only one used to assign or unassign a category to a shared catalog.

Name | Description | Format | Requirements
--- | --- | --- | ---
`id` | The category ID number | integer | Required to assign or unassign a category

### Assign categories to shared catalog

The following example adds the Luma Gear category (`id=3`) as well as its subcategories (`id=4,5,6`) to a custom shared catalog.

**Sample usage:**

`POST <host>/rest/<store_code>/V1/sharedCatalog/2/assignCategories`

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": 3
    },
    {
      "id": 4
    },
    {
      "id": 5
    },
    {
      "id": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response:**

`true`, indicating the operation was successful

### Unassign categories from a shared catalog

When you unassign a category from a shared catalog, Magento also removes its products from the shared catalog. If a product is assigned to multiple categories, then Magento removes the product from the unassigned category only.

The following example removes two categories from the shared catalog.

**Sample usage:**

`POST <host>/rest/<store_code>/V1/sharedCatalog/2/unassignCategories`

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": 7
    },

    {
      "id": 8
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response:**

`true`, indicating the operation was successful

### List the shared catalog categories

The `GET` call returns an array of catalog IDs.

**Sample Usage:**

`GET <host>/rest/<store_code>/V1/sharedCatalog/2/categories`

**Payload:**

Not applicable

**Response:**

```json
[
  3,
  4,
  5,
  6
]
```

## Assign products

The `sharedCatalogProductManagementV1` service is based on `catalogProductManagementV1`. To return a list of products defined within a category, call `GET /V1/categories/:categoryId/products`.

**Service name:**

`sharedCatalogProductManagementV1`

**REST endpoints:**

```terminal
POST  /V1/sharedCatalog/:id/assignProducts
POST  /V1/sharedCatalog/:id/unassignProducts
GET  /V1/sharedCatalog/:id/products
```

**Category parameters:**

{: .bs-callout-info }
Although you can specify other parameters defined within a `products` object, the `sku` is the only one used to assign or unassign a product to a shared catalog.

Name | Description | Format | Requirements
--- | --- | --- | ---
`sku` | The product's SKU identifier | string | Required to assign or unassign a product to a shared catalog

### Assign products to shared catalog

The following example adds two products each in the Bags, Fitness Equipment, and Watches categories to a custom shared catalog. The specified products do not have to be in the same category.

**Sample usage:**

`POST <host>/rest/<store_code>/V1/sharedCatalog/2/assignProducts`

**Payload:**

```json
{
 "products": [
     {
         "sku": "24-MB01"
     },
     {
         "sku": "24-MB04"
     },
     {
         "sku": "24-UG06"
     },
     {
         "sku": "24-UG07"
     },
     {
         "sku": "24-MG04"
     },
     {
         "sku": "24-MG01"
     }
 ]
}
```

**Response:**

`true`, indicating the operation was successful

### Unassign products from the shared catalog

**Sample usage:**

{
  "products": [
   {
     "sku": "24-MG01"
   }
  ]
}
```
