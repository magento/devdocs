The company credit entity operates with the following attributes:

*  Credit limit
*  Available credit
*  Outstanding balance

The credit limit is allocated by seller, while available credit and outstanding balance are automatically calculated by the system based on the buyer transactions (place an order, return) and seller's transactions (refund, reimburse, update credit limit, cancel order).

## Manage company credit limits

When you create a company, the credit limit is set to 0. Use the `PUT /V1/companyCredits/:id` call to change this value and perform other updates to the company's credit settings.

**REST Endpoints:**

```terminal
PUT /V1/companyCredits/:id
GET /V1/companyCredits/:creditId

`id` | The credit ID generated by the system | Integer | Required
`company_id` | Company ID | Integer | Required
`credit_limit` | The amount of credit granted to the company | Float | Required
`balance` | The amount the company currently owes the seller | Float | Optional
`currency_code` | The currency code for the company's credit, such as USD | String | Required
`exceed_limit` | Indicates whether the company can exceed their credit limit | Boolean  | Optional
