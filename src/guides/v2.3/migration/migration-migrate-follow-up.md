## Overview

Some behavior and logic of Magento 1 has been implemented differently in Magento 2. The Data Migration Tool takes care of it. Although, there are some migration aspects you should know about, and sometimes you must take minor steps for some functionalities to work smoothly after migration.

## Information

### Split database not supported

The Data Migration Tool doesn't support split databases.

### Group Prices converted to Tier Prices

All Group Prices are automatically converted to Tier Prices during migration.

### New numbering for sales entities

Reference numbers for Orders, Invoices, Shipments, Credit Memos, and RMA migrate as is. But after migration, the new Magento 2 number assignment rules will apply. Thus, the numeration for the new sales entities will be different.

## Steps

### Resave Customer Segments [{{site.data.var.ee}} only]

After migration, Customer Segments must be resaved from the [Admin](https://glossary.magento.com/admin) Panel to get them up and running.

### Configure time zone

The tool does not migrate timezone settings, so you must manually configure the timezone after migration at **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Locale Options** > **Timezone**.
By default, Magento stores time data in the UTC-0 zone in the database and displays it according to the current timezone settings.
If time data has already been saved in the database in a zone other than UTC-0, you must convert the existing time to UTC-0 using the Data Migration Toolâ€™s `\Migration\Handler\Timezone` handler.

In the following example, Magento 1 has been incorrectly saving time in the UTC-7 zone in the database (for example, due to a faulty third-party extension). To properly convert the customer account creation time to the UTC-0 zone upon migration, add the following rule to the `map-customer.xml` file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<map xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xs:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="../map.xsd">
  <!--...-->
  <destination>
      <field_rules>
          <!--...-->
          <transform>
              <field>customer_entity.created_at</field>
              <handler class="\Migration\Handler\Timezone">
                  <param name="offset" value="-7" />
              </handler>
          </transform>
      </field_rules>
  </destination>
</map>
```
