Responsive web design (RWD, also referred as *responsive design*) crafts websites to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices (from large, high-resolution desktop computer monitors to mobile phones).

The out of the box Magento Blank and Luma themes (Luma [inherits]({{ page.baseurl }}/frontend-dev-guide/themes/theme-inherit.html) from Blank) use the mobile first RWD approach. It is ensured mostly by means of CSS and JavaScript.

The following image illustrates how the same page built on the Blank [theme](https://glossary.magento.com/theme) looks on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

The articles in this chapter describe the particular approaches used in the Blank theme, and provide practical recommendations on how to use these approaches in your themes:
