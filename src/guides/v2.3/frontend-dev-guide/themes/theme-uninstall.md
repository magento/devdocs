## What's in this topic

This topic describes how to uninstall a [storefront](https://glossary.magento.com/storefront) [theme](https://glossary.magento.com/theme) in Magento 2.

The way a theme should be uninstalled is defined by two factors:

*  the way the theme was added: manually added (installed or created), installed as [composer](https://glossary.magento.com/composer) package or as an [extension](https://glossary.magento.com/extension).
*  the way Magento was installed: [using the source files from GitHub]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-sample-data-clone.html) or [using Composer]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-sample-data-composer.html).

The following sections describe the flow for uninstalling themes in each case.

## Prerequisites

1. [Set your Magento application to the developer or default mode]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-mode.html).
1. Make sure that the theme is not applied on the storefront. To do this, in the [Admin](https://glossary.magento.com/admin) panel navigate to **Content** > Design > **Configuration** and make sure that your custom theme is not applied for any [store view](https://glossary.magento.com/store-view).
1. Make sure that the theme is not defined as a parent for any registered theme. To do this, in the Admin panel, navigate to **Content** > Design > **Themes**. Make sure that your theme is not mentioned in the **Parent Theme** column. If it is mentioned, you need to uninstall the child theme first.

## Uninstall a manually added theme

In case if your theme was created or installed manually, the uninstall procedure is the same, regardless the way Magento was installed.

To uninstall a manually added theme:

1. Navigate to the vendor directory where the theme was installed. This directory should be: `<Magento root dir>/app/design/frontend/<VendorName>`.
1. Remove the theme directory.
1. Remove the theme record from database. If you are using MySQL, run the following command to do this:

```bash
mysql -u <user> -p -e "delete from <dbname>.theme where theme_path ='<Vendor>/<theme>' AND area ='frontend' limit 1"
```

Where:

*  `<user>`: your Magento database username
*  `<dbname>`: your Magento database name
*  `<Vendor>/<theme>`: relative path to the theme directory

## Uninstall a theme package {#uninstall_theme_pack}

The flow for uninstalling a theme that is [Composer package](https://glossary.magento.com/composer-package) is different, depending on the way your Magento instance was installed.

### Uninstall a theme package if Magento was installed using Composer

If both the theme and the Magento instance were installed using Composer, you can use a special CLI command. Follow the instructions from the [Uninstall themes Composer package]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-theme-uninstall.html) topic.

### Uninstall a theme package if Magento was installed by cloning the repository

To uninstall a theme Composer package if your Magento instance was installed by cloning the Git repository, you can also uninstall it using a CLI command. However, you must first remove it from the list of dependencies.

Take the following steps:

1. Open the `<Magento root dir>/composer.json` file.
1. Find a line with a reference to theme package and delete it. The reference would look like following:

   ```json
   "require": {
    ...
       "<vendor>/<theme-name>": "<version>"
   },
   ```

1. To update the project dependencies, run:

   ```bash
   composer update
   ```

1. Use the `magento theme:uninstall` CLI command as described in the [Uninstall themes Composer package]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-theme-uninstall.html) topic.

You can use the Composer remove command to remove the dependency, but in that case, you must delete the theme record from the database manually.

## Uninstall a theme extension

If the theme was installed as an extension, you can uninstall it using one of the following flows:

*  the same way as theme Composer packages are uninstalled, see the [Uninstall a theme package](#uninstall_theme_pack) section for details.
*  using the Component Manager.

To uninstall a theme extension using the Component Manager:

1. In the [Magento Admin](https://glossary.magento.com/magento-admin) Panel, navigate to **System** > **Web Setup Wizard** > **Extension Manager**.
1. In the **Actions** column, click **Select** > **Uninstall** in the theme record.
