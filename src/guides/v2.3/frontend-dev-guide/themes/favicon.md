## What's in this topic {#favicon-intro}

This topic describes how to add custom favicons.

## General overview

Magento provides a default 16px x 16px [favicon](https://glossary.magento.com/favicon) that you can override by uploading a custom icon in the Magento Admin, or by adding it manually in a specific location in a [theme](https://glossary.magento.com/theme) directory.
If both favicons exist, the one you uploaded in the [Admin](https://glossary.magento.com/admin) takes precedence.

If you want to have favicons of different sizes, you need to add them manually in the file system and define in [layout](https://glossary.magento.com/layout).

Magento supports the following file types for favicon: `.ico`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.apng`, `.svg`. Not all browsers support all these formats. The most widely supported file format to use for a favicon is `.ico`.

See the following sections for details about adding favicons.

## Adding a custom favicon in Admin

To add a custom favicon in the Magento Admin, do the following:

1. Navigate to **Content** > Design > **Configuration**.
1. In the scope grid, decide on which level you will configure the favicon and click **Edit** in the corresponding row.

   ![favicon 1]({{site.baseurl}}/common/images/favicon_2_21.png)

1. Under the **Other Settings** title, expand the **HTML Head** options.
1. Next to **Favicon Icon**, click **Upload**, and select the file.

   ![favicon 2]({{site.baseurl}}/common/images/favicon_1_21.png)

1. Click **Save Configuration** in the upper right corner to save the changes.

If caching is enabled in your Admin, you get a notification that refreshing certain [cache](https://glossary.magento.com/cache) types is required. Click the link provided in the notification, and then click **Flush Magento Cache**. You can also navigate to **System** > Tools > **Cache Management** and click **Flush Magento Cache**, or run `bin/magento cache:flush`.

## Add custom favicons manually

To override the default 16px x 16px favicon manually, add your custom `favicon.ico` in the `<your_theme_dir>/Magento_Theme/web/`directory.

To add favicon icons of other sizes, take the following steps:

1. Add your icons in the `<your_theme_dir>/Magento_Theme/web/` directory.
1. In the `<your_theme_dir>/Magento_Theme/layout/default_head_blocks.xml` layout file specify the paths to the icons and their sizes.

For example, if you added a `favicon-32x32.png` icon and want it to be used as a 32px x 32px favicon, your `default_head_blocks.xml` would be like following:

```xml
<page xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:View/Layout/etc/page_configuration.xsd">
    <head>
        <link src="Magento_Theme::favicon-32x32.png" rel="icon" sizes="32x32" />
    </head>
</page>
```

For your changes to be applied, clear the browser cache, and the following directories on the server (do not delete the `.htaccess` file!):

-  `pub/static`
-  all directories under `var`
