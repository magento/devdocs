These topics discuss how to set up a custom cron job and optionally a custom cron group. If your Magento [extension](https://glossary.magento.com/extension) requires scheduled tasks to run periodically, you can use these topics to set up a cron *job* (the scheduled task) and optionally a cron *group* (which runs custom tasks at the same time).

If you use a Magento-provided cron group, you don't have to define a custom cron group; however, if you want your cron jobs to run at a different schedule or you want them all to run together, you should define a cron group

The Magento application provides the following cron groups:

*  `default`, which contains most cron jobs
*  `index`, which refreshes [indexers]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-index.html)
*  These topics are available in {{site.data.var.ee}} only
   *  `staging`, which runs [Staging-related](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/cms/content-staging.html) tasks
   *  `catalog_event`, which runs tasks for target and shopping cart rules
