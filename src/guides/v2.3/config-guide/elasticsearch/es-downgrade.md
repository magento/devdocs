The Magento 2.3.5 update adds support for Elasticsearch (ES) 6.8.x and 7.x.x.

Both ES 2.x and 5.x are [End of Life][] and are no longer supported in Magento.

## Change the Elasticsearch Client version

If you need to work with Elasticsearch 7.1.x, run the following command:

```bash
composer require "elasticsearch/elasticsearch:~7.1"
```

To work with Elasticsearch 6.8.x, run the following command:

```bash
composer require "elasticsearch/elasticsearch:~6.8"
```

Then configure Elasticsearch within [Magento Admin][].
