## Before you begin {#instgde-prereq-overview}

Before you install Magento, you must do all of the following:

*  Set up one or more hosts that meet the [Magento system requirements]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/system-requirements.html).
*  If you are setting up more than one web node with load balancing, set up and test that part of your system _before_ you install Magento.
*  Make sure you can back up your entire system at various points during the installation so you can roll back in the [event](https://glossary.magento.com/event) of issues.

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
We assume you're installing the Magento 2 software in a **development environment**, which means you have [root user](http://www.linfo.org/root.html) access to the machine **and** that the machine does not need to be highly secure. If you're setting up a more secure machine, we strongly recommend you consult a network administrator for additional assistance.

We strongly recommend you update and upgrade your operating system software. These upgrades can provide security and software fixes that might prevent future problems. Don't know what any of this means? Check out our [installation overview page]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/bk-install-guide.html).

Enter the following commands as a user with `root` privileges:

*  Ubuntu

```bash
apt-get update
```

```bash
apt-get upgrade
```

*  CentOS

```bash
yum -y update
```

```bash
yum -y upgrade
```

## Prerequisite check {#instgde-prereq-check}

To check your system for prerequisites, enter the following commands:

### Apache

CentOS: `httpd -v`

Ubuntu: `apache2 -v`

Magento supports Apache version 2.4 as the following result indicates:

```terminal
Server version: Apache/2.4.0 (Unix)
Server built:   Jul 23 2017 14:17:29
```

To install or upgrade Apache, see [Apache]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/prereq/apache.html).

### PHP

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
Magento 2.3.3 supports PHP 7.2.
All 3rd party libraries now support PHP 7.2.
If you are interested in participating in Magento Community projects we welcome your help! See our [ZenHub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/magento-engcom/php-7.2-support/boards?repos=116423356,116426364,115111902) for a full list of outstanding issues.

```bash
php -v
```

{% include install/php-versions-template.md %}

You must run [PHP](https://glossary.magento.com/php) version 7.2 or 7.3:

```terminal
PHP 7.2.0 (cli) (built: Jan  9 2018 09:23:16) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) 1997-2017 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.1.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2018 Zend Technologies with Zend OPcache v7.1.6, Copyright (c) 1999-2018, by Zend Technologies
```

See [PHP](/guides/v2.3/install-gde/prereq/php-settings.html) for info on PHP requirements.

### MySQL

```bash
mysql -u <database root user or database owner name> -p
```

For example:

```bash
mysql -u magento -p
```

You must run MySQL version 5.6 or later as the following result indicates:

```terminal
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 871

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

Enter `exit` at the `mysql>` prompt to exit.
