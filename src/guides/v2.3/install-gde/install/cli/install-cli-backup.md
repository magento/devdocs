## Overview of backup {#instgde-cli-uninst-back-over}

This command enables you to back up:

*  The Magento file system (excluding `var` and `pub/static` directories)
*  The `pub/media` directory
*  The Magento 2 database

Backups are stored in the `var/backups` directory and can be restored at any time using the [magento setup:rollback]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-uninstall-mods.html#instgde-cli-uninst-mod-roll) command.

After backing up, you can [roll back](#instgde-cli-uninst-roll) at a later time.

## Roll back {#instgde-cli-uninst-roll}

This section discusses how to roll back to a backup you made previously. You must know the file name of the backup file to restore.

To find the name of your backups, enter:

```bash
bin/magento info:backups:list
```

The first string in the backup file name is the timestamp.

To roll back to a previous backup, enter:

```bash
bin/magento setup:rollback [-c|--code-file="<name>"] [-m|--media-file="<name>"] [-d|--db-file="<name>"]
```

For example, to restore a media backup named `1440611839_filesystem_media.tgz`, enter

```bash
bin/magento setup:rollback -m 1440611839_filesystem_media.tgz
```

Messages similar to the following display:

```terminal
[SUCCESS]: Media rollback completed successfully.
Please set file permission of bin/magento to executable
