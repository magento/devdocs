Following are symptoms of cron issues:

*  An error message about the [PHP](https://glossary.magento.com/php) setting `$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA` displays even though it's set properly
*  The PHP readiness check doesn't display the PHP version as the following figure shows.

*  The following error displays in the Magento Admin:

   ![cron isn't running]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/compman-cron-not-running.png){:width="550px"}

   To see the error, you might need to click **System Messages** at the top of the window as follows:
