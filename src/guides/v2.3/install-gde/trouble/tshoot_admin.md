### Details

  The requested URL /magento2index.php/admin/admin/dashboard/index/key/0c81957145a968b697c32a846598dc2e/ was not found on this server.

Note the lack of a slash character between `magento2` and `index.php` in the [URL](https://glossary.magento.com/url).

### Solution

The base URL is not correct. The base URL must:

*  Start with `http://` or `https://`
*  End with a slash (`/`)
*  Match the case of the `web/unsecure/base_url` record in the `core_config_data` database table

Re-run the installation using a valid value.
