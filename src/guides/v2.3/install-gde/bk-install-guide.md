## Useful information

Use the links on the left side of the page to navigate topics in each part of the installation.

## Required server permissions

UNIX systems require `root` privileges to install and configure software like a web server, PHP, and so on. If you need to install this software, make sure you have `root` access.

You should *not* install the Magento software in the web server docroot as the `root` user because the web server might not be able to interact with those files.

You'll also need `root` privileges to create the [file system owner] and add that owner to the web server's group. You'll use the [file system owner](https://glossary.magento.com/magento-file-system-owner) to run any commands from the command line and to set up the Magento cron job, which schedules tasks for you.
