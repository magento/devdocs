## Step 3. Data Option

This step displays if you're uninstalling extensions.

After backing up, you have the choice of removing data from the Magento 2 database.

If the [extension](https://glossary.magento.com/extension) has no data to remove, the following message displays. (If a extension has data but no uninstall script, the same prompt displays. In that case, contact the vendor or remove database data manually.)

```terminal
The selected extension has no data to remove.
```

If the extension has data to remove, a page similar to the following displays.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cman_uninstall-data.png" width="600px" alt="You can optionally remove database data">

Click one of the following:

*  **Keep data**: Click to keep the data in the database.
*  **Remove data**: Click to remove data from the database.

   You can click **Back** to back up the database first if you did not do so already.

Continue with [Step 4. Uninstall]({{ page.baseurl }}/comp-mgr/extens-man/extensman-uninst-final.html)
