For more number formats, use the Associated Press (AP) Stylebook on first reference, and the Microsoft Manual of Style on second reference.

## Basic Standards

<ul>
  <li>For numbers 10 and higher, use numerals. For numbers lower than 10, spell out numbers. <em>See correct examples:</em>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li>Yes – “We offer this service in nine countries.”</li>
      <li>Yes – “Over 200 companies use this service.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In headlines and "pull quotes", where the number is the focus, use numerals. <em>See correct examples:</em>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li>Yes – “1 in 3 shoppers ...”</li>
      <li>Yes – “We’re #1”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use numerals for all numbers in the following cases:
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li>Units of measurement, including inches, acres, pounds, mph, and percentages</li>
      <li>Street addresses <em>Example:</em> 9 Franklin St.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For large numbers, we use a comma.
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li><em>Correct example:</em> 200,000 - never "200k" or "200 thousand"</li>
      <li><em>Exception:</em> In large-format printing, we can use “200k” to add impact. Where this can be used: Posters, billboards, and small internet banners where space is tight.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

## Addresses

See [Addresses]({{ page.baseurl }}/design-styleguide/content-formats/content-formats.html#addresses) section in Content Formats.

## Percentages

In regular text, write out “percent”. However, the ”%” sign can be used in call-outs, graphics, and large-format content (*Example:* posters).

*Example:*

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li><strong>No</strong> – “Merchants have reported increased sales of up to 130%”</li>
  <li>Yes – “Merchants have reported increased sales of up to 130 percent.”</li>
</ul>

## Money

Do not add a space between the symbol and the number. ... *Examples:* $781, £490, €2,183

This is how we write about money:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="4">Examples:</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>No</strong> – “$2.00"<br />
      <strong>No</strong> – “$ 2"<br />
      Yes – “$2”<br />
      Yes – “$2.01”</td>
      <td><strong>No</strong> – “$1232"<br />
      <strong>No</strong> – “$1232.00"<br />
      Yes – “$1,232”</td>
      <td><strong>No</strong> – “$53,000,000"<br />
      <strong>No</strong> – “$53m"<br />
      <strong>No</strong> – “$53mil"<br />
      Yes – “$53 million”</td>
      <td><strong>No</strong> – “$1,200,000"<br />
      <strong>No</strong> – “$1.2m"<br />
      Yes – “$1.2 million”</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Dates and Times

### Dates

*  Do not abbreviate months of the year when they appear by themselves or with a year. ... *Correct example:* "September 2015"."

*  Months:

   *  March, April, May, June, and July are never abbreviated in text.

   *  The remaining months are only abbreviated when followed by a date (Jan. 27).

   *  *Abbreviations to use:* Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec.

*  Never abbreviate ...

   *  Days of the week ... *Correct example:* Use "Wednesday", not "Weds.".

   *  Years ... *Correct example:* Use "2017", not "'17".

**Correct Examples:**

*  The conference begins ...

   *  In September

   *  In September 2017

   *  Sept. 8

   *  Friday, Sept. 8

   *  Friday, Sept. 8, 2017

*  *Date-range format, in a sentence:* The conference runs Sept. 8-12, 2017.

### Times

**General Usage:**

*  Formatting. Use numerals and "am" or "pm" without a space. Example: 10am.

*  Omit ":00". Don’t use minutes for on-the-hour time.

*  Example: Exclude minutes for "7am"; include minutes for "10:30pm".

*  Use "noon" and "midnight". Do not use 12pm and 12am.

**Time Ranges:**

<ul>
  <li>Use a hyphen between times to indicate a time period. <em>Example:</em> 7am-10:30pm.</li>
  <li>Exclude the "am" and "pm" when times are both either in the morning or after noon.<br>
  <em>Example:</em>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li><strong>No</strong> – “6am-9am"</li>
      <li>Yes – “6-9am”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Simplify range language:<br>
  <em>Example:</em>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li><strong>No</strong> – “Holiday store hours go from 8am-10pm."</li>
      <li>Yes – “Holiday store hours are 8am-10pm.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

**Time Zones:**

*  Formatting. When a time is not adjusted by the system to reflect the current time zone, append the time zone after the time. ... *Correct examples:* "7:30am CT", "7-10:30am CT"

*  Do not indicate standard or daylight time. ... *Correct example:* Central Time is written as "CT", not "CST" or "CDT".

*  Do not use military time. ... *Incorrect example:* Using 19:40, instead of 7:40pm.
