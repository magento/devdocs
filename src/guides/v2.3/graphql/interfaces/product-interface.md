Any type that implements `ProductInterface` contains all the base attributes necessary for the frontend of the product model.
The `items` that are returned in a `ProductInterface` array can also contain attributes from resources external to the `CatalogGraphQl` module:

-  Custom and extension attributes defined in any attribute set
-  The attribute is defined in the [PhysicalProductInterface](#PhysicalProductInterface) or [CustomizableOptionInterface]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/interfaces/customizable-option-interface.html)
-  Product types that define their own implementation of `ProductInterface` including:
   -  [SimpleProduct]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/interfaces/simple-product.html)
   -  [BundleProduct]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/interfaces/bundle-product.html)
   -  [ConfigurableProduct]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/interfaces/configurable-product.html)
   -  [DownloadableProduct]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/interfaces/downloadable-product.html)
   -  [GiftCardProduct]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/interfaces/gift-card-product.html)
   -  [GroupedProduct]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/interfaces/grouped-product.html)
   -  [VirtualProduct]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/interfaces/virtual-product.html)
