A resolver performs GraphQL request processing. In general, it is responsible for constructing a query, fetching data and performing any calculations, then transforming the fetched and calculated data into a GraphQL array format. Finally, it returns the results wrapped by a callable function.

A GraphQL request is represented by the following arguments, which will be processed by a resolver:

Field | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
$field | [`Magento\Framework\GraphQl\Config\Element\Field`]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/GraphQl/Config/Element/Field.php) | Fields are used to describe possible values for a type/interface
$context | [`Magento\Framework\GraphQl\Query\Resolver\ContextInterface`]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/GraphQl/Query/Resolver/ContextInterface.php) | Resolver context is used as a shared data extensible object in all resolvers that implement [`ResolverInterface`]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/GraphQl/Query/ResolverInterface.php).
$info | [`Magento\Framework\GraphQl\Schema\Type\ResolveInfo`]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/GraphQl/Schema/Type/ResolveInfo.php) | Structure containing information useful for field resolution process.
$value | array | Contains additional query parameters. `Null` in most cases.
$args | array | Contains input arguments of query.

A GraphQL resolver must implement one of the following interfaces:

-  [`\Magento\Framework\GraphQl\Query\Resolver\BatchResolverInterface`]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/GraphQl/Query/Resolver/BatchResolverInterface.php)

-  [`\Magento\Framework\GraphQl\Query\Resolver\BatchServiceContractResolverInterface`]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/GraphQl/Query/Resolver/BatchServiceContractResolverInterface.php)

-  [`\Magento\Framework\GraphQl\Query\ResolverInterface`]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/GraphQl/Query/ResolverInterface.php)

The first two interfaces provide a way to resolve multiple branches/leaves at once (known as batching), while the last one resolves one request at a time. Magento recommends using batch resolvers for queries because they improve performance by fetching information required to resolve multiple GraphQL requests with a single operation.

## Query resolvers

### BatchResolverInterface

Batch resolvers gather GraphQL requests for the same field until there is no way to process the tree further without resolving previous requests.

Consider the following example:

```graphql
query ($filter: ProductAttributeFilterInput!) {
  products (filter: $filter) {
    items {
      id
      sku
      related_products {
        sku
        related_products {
          sku
        }
      }
    }
    total_count
  }
}
```

The query loads a list of products, the SKUs of their related products, and then any secondary related product SKUs.

Loading a list of related products individually for each product would be expensive performance-wise. With batch resolvers, you can load linked products for all products that were initially found, then group them by root products. After the `items` branch is resolved, a batch resolver for `related_products` will be called for the first product found. Instead of resolving the list right away, it will just add the first product to the list of products that require loading additional related products. After all the products from the `items` branch have been loaded, the lists of related products must be loaded. Then, `BatchResolverInterface::resolve()` executes with a gathered list of previous requests to `related_products` branches. At this point, the resolver is able to extract product DTOs from each GraphQL request, load all the product links, sort them by root products, and generate GraphQL values for each branch. After this is done, the same batching will take place when resolving child `related_products` branches.

The following pseudo-code shows a `related_products` branch resolver:

```php
class RelatedProducts implements BatchResolverInterface
{
    ...

    public function resolve(ContextInterface $context, Field $field, array $requests): BatchResponse
    {
        //Get the list of products we need to load related products for
        $rootProductIds = array_map(function ($request) { return $request->getValue()['model']->getId(); }, $requests);

        //Load the links
        $productLinks = $this->service->getRelatedProductLinks($rootProductIds);

        //Sort the links
        $response = new BatchResponse();
        foreach ($requests as $request) {
            $response->addResponse($request, $productLinks[$request->getValue()['model']->getId()]);
        }

        return $response;
    }
}
```

Each GraphQL request object must be assigned a [`\Magento\Framework\GraphQl\Query\Resolver\Value`]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/GraphQl/Query/Resolver/Value.php) result type or any type of data (mixed). This value takes in a callable function to its constructor that will be invoked at the latest possible time for the resolver to acquire its data. As a result, a list of items being resolved can be retrieved all at once by establishing a buffer that contains all relevant parent data to filter and fetch for the children list data.

[`\Magento\RelatedProductGraphQl\Model\Resolver\Batch\AbstractLinkedProducts`]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/app/code/Magento/RelatedProductGraphQl/Model/Resolver/Batch/AbstractLikedProducts.php) contains an example of batch resolver implementation.

### BatchServiceContractResolverInterface

Requests for this interface to resolve are gathered into batches in the same way as for `BatchResolverInterface`, except that the actual resolving is delegated to a batch service contract. The job of the `BatchServiceContractResolverInterface` resolver is to convert GraphQL requests into DTOs acceptable by the service contract, and then convert results returned by the contract into a GraphQL response.

Consider the same example query:

```graphql
query ($filter: ProductAttributeFilterInput!) {
  products (filter: $filter) {
    items {
      id
      sku
      related_products {
        sku
        related_products {
          sku
        }
      }
    }
    total_count
  }
}
```

Here, we will delegate loading all related products to a service that accepts a list of root product IDs, and then returns individual lists for each.

Pseudo-code for a GraphQL resolver delegating the work to a service contract may look like this:

```php
class RelatedProductsResolver implements BatchServiceContractResolverInterface
{
    ...

    public function getServiceContract(): array
    {
        return [ProductLinksRetriever::class, 'getRelatedProducts'];
    }

    public function convertToServiceArgument(ResolveRequestInterface $request)
    {
        return new RootProductCriteria($request->getValue()['model']->getId());
    }

    public function convertFromServiceResult($result, ResolveRequestInterface $request)
    {
        return $result->getLinkedProducts();
    }
}
```

The `getServiceContract()` method points to the service contract to be used.

The `convertToServiceArgument()` method converts GraphQL requests to a criteria item to be passed in a list as the argument to the contract. Remember that batch service contract methods must accept a single argument: a list (array) of criteria objects.

The `convertFromServiceResult()` method converts one of the result items into a GraphQL response (a [`\Magento\Framework\GraphQl\Query\Resolver\Value`]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/GraphQl/Query/Resolver/Value.php) instance or an array). Remember that batch service contracts must return result items in the same order as were the criteria items passed as the method's list argument.

The batch service contract used in the example would look something like this:

```php
class ProductLinksRetriever
{
    ...

    /**
     * @param RootProductCriteria[] $criteriaList
     * @return RelatedProductsFound[]
     */
    public function getRelatedProducts(array $criteriaList): array
    {
        ....
    }
}

class RootProductCriteria
{
    ....

    public function __construct(int $rootProductId)
    {
        $this->productId = $rootProductId;
    }

    public function getRootProductId(): int
    {
        return $this->productId;
    }
}

class RelatedProductsFound
{
    ....

    public function getLinkedProducts(): array
    {
        ....
    }

    public function getRootProductId(): int
    {
        ....
    }
}
```

A real example can be found at [\Magento\CatalogGraphQl\Model\Resolver\Product\BatchProductLinks]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/app/code/Magento/CatalogGraphQl/Model/Resolver/Product/BatchProductLinks.php)

### ResolverInterface

This interface resolves one branch or leaf at a time. It returns [`\Magento\Framework\GraphQl\Query\Resolver\Value`]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/GraphQl/Query/Resolver/Value.php) or any type of data (mixed). This value takes in a callable function to its constructor that will be invoked at the latest possible time for the resolver to acquire its data. As a result, a list of items being resolved can be retrieved all at once by establishing a buffer that contains all relevant parent data to filter and fetch for the children list data.

You can view an example inside the [`\Magento\BundleGraphQl\Model\Resolver\BundleItemLinks`]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/app/code/Magento/BundleGraphQl/Model/Resolver/BundleItemLinks.php) resolver. This resolver takes each bundle option ID and its corresponding parent product ID and stores them in a collection's filter buffer (in this case, using the [`\Magento\BundleGraphQl\Model\Resolver\Links\Collection::addIdFilters()`]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/app/code/Magento/BundleGraphQl/Model/Resolver/Links/Collection.php#L62-L70) function). Each resolver then returns a callable that invokes this collection. The collection caches the result of all link entities it fetched for all the option_id/parent_id combinations. This fetch only needs to occur once for the whole `BundleItemLink` list, and each resulting callable that is invoked for every link in the list returns an item from the collections cached result.

A `Value` object wraps a callable object, and you can use [`\Magento\Framework\GraphQl\Query\Resolver\ValueFactory`]({{ site.mage2bloburl }}/{{ page.guide_version }}/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/GraphQl/Query/Resolver/ValueFactory.php) to create a value.

## Mutation requirements

Like queries, mutations are also defined within the `<module_name>/etc/schema.graphqls` file.

### Mutation syntax

```text
type Mutation {
    mutationQueryName(inputParamName: MutationQueryInputType, inputParamName2: MutationQueryInputType2, ...): MutationQueryOutput @resolver(class: "Magento\\<module_name>\\Model\\Resolver\\MutationResolverModel") @doc(description:"Mutation query description")
}
```

Syntax option | Description
--- | ---
`mutationQueryName` | The name of mutation
`inputParamName` | Input parameters for the mutation (optional)
`MutationQueryInputType` | The type of input parameter, such as `String`, `Int`, or a custom type, like `MyCustomInput`
`MutationQueryOutput` | The mutation's result type, such as  `String`, `Int`, or a custom type, like `MyCustomOutput`
`@resolver(class)` | The class of the resolver
`@doc(description)` | Describes the purpose of the mutation
`@deprecated(reason: "description")` | Use `@deprecated` to mark a query, mutation, or attribute as deprecated

### Resolver class

Use the following sample code as a template for the GraphQL resolver mutation class:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Copyright © Magento, Inc. All rights reserved.
 * See COPYING.txt for license details.
 */
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Magento\<module_name>\Model\Resolver;

use Magento\Framework\GraphQl\Config\Element\Field;
use Magento\Framework\GraphQl\Query\ResolverInterface;
use Magento\Framework\GraphQl\Schema\Type\ResolveInfo;

/**
 * @inheritdoc
 */
class MutationResolverModel implements ResolverInterface
{
    /**
     * @inheritdoc
     */
    public function resolve(Field $field, $context, ResolveInfo $info, array $value = null, array $args = null)
    {
        // resolver functionality ...
    }
}
```

### Example usage

The mutation query below creates an empty cart and returns a cart unique identifier

```text
type Mutation {
    createEmptyCart: String @resolver(class: "\\Magento\\QuoteGraphQl\\Model\\Resolver\\CreateEmptyCart") @doc(description:"Creates an empty shopping cart for a guest or logged in user")
}
```

Notice that a `MutationQueryInput` parameter is not specified here and `MutationQueryOutput` is defined as `String` type.

The mutation to create a customer's account is more complex:

```text
type Mutation {
    createCustomer (input: CustomerInput!): CustomerOutput @resolver(class: "\\Magento\\CustomerGraphQl\\Model\\Resolver\\CreateCustomer") @doc(description:"Create customer account")
}
```

The `!` character indicates `CustomerInput` is a required input parameter. `CustomerInput` is defined as follows:

```text
input CustomerInput {
    prefix: String @doc(description: "An honorific, such as Dr., Mr., or Mrs.")
    firstname: String @doc(description: "The customer's first name")
    middlename: String @doc(description: "The customer's middle name")
    lastname: String @doc(description: "The customer's family name")
    suffix: String @doc(description: "A value such as Sr., Jr., or III")
    email: String @doc(description: "The customer's email address. Required")
    date_of_birth: String @doc(description: "The customer's date of birth.")
    taxvat: String @doc(description: "The customer's Tax/VAT number (for corporate customers)")
    gender: Int @doc(description: "The customer's gender(Male - 1, Female - 2)")
    password: String @doc(description: "The customer's password")
    is_subscribed: Boolean @doc(description: "Indicates whether the customer is subscribed to the company's newsletter")
}
```

In keeping with current security and privacy best practices, be sure you are aware of any potential legal and security risks associated with the storage of customers’ full date of birth (month, day, year) along with other personal identifiers, such as full name, before collecting or processing such data.

The `createCustomer` mutation returns `CustomerOutput` object

```text
type CustomerOutput {
    customer: Customer!
}
```

The `customer` parameter of the `CustomerOutput` object is a type of `Customer` object:

```text
type Customer @doc(description: "Customer defines the customer name and address and other details") {
    created_at: String @doc(description: "Timestamp indicating when the account was created")
    prefix: String @doc(description: "An honorific, such as Dr., Mr., or Mrs.")
    firstname: String @doc(description: "The customer's first name")
    middlename: String @doc(description: "The customer's middle name")
    lastname: String @doc(description: "The customer's family name")
    suffix: String @doc(description: "A value such as Sr., Jr., or III")
    email: String @doc(description: "The customer's email address. Required")
    default_billing: String @doc(description: "The ID assigned to the billing address")
    default_shipping: String @doc(description: "The ID assigned to the shipping address")
    date_of_birth: String @doc(description: "The customer's date of birth")
    taxvat: String @doc(description: "The customer's Tax/VAT number (for corporate customers)")
    is_subscribed: Boolean @doc(description: "Indicates whether the customer is subscribed to the company's newsletter") @resolver(class: "\\Magento\\CustomerGraphQl\\Model\\Resolver\\IsSubscribed")
    addresses: [CustomerAddress] @doc(description: "An array containing the customer's shipping and billing addresses")
    gender: Int @doc(description: "The customer's gender (Male - 1, Female - 2)")
}

{:.bs-callout-info}
In keeping with current security and privacy best practices, be sure you are aware of any potential legal and security risks associated with the storage of customers’ full date of birth (month, day, year) along with other personal identifiers, such as full name, before collecting or processing such data.

The following example shows the `createCustomer` mutation in action:

```text
mutation {
    createCustomer(
        input: {
            firstname: "John"
            lastname: "Doe"
            email: "j.doe@example.com"
            password: "1w2E3R456"
            is_subscribed: true
        }
    ) {
        customer {
            firstname
            lastname
            email
            is_subscribed
        }
    }
}
```

A sample response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createCustomer": {
      "customer": {
        "firstname": "John",
        "lastname": "Doe",
        "email": "j.doe@example.com",
        "is_subscribed": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
