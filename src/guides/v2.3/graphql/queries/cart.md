Use the `cart` query to retrieve information about a particular cart.

Cart functionality is defined in the `Quote` module. A Quote represents the contents of a customer's shopping cart. It is responsible for performing tasks such as:

*  Tracking each item in the cart, including the quantity and base cost
*  Determining estimated shipping costs
*  Calculating subtotals, computing additional costs, applying coupons, and determining the payment method

## Syntax

`{cart(cart_id: String!) {Cart}}`

## Sample queries

### Cart discounts

In this query, the **Buy 3 tee shirts and get the 4th free** cart price rule from the sample data is active. This rule was modified slightly to add the label `3T1free`.  (If a cart price rule does not have a label, Magento returns a default label of `Discount`.) A custom rule in which the customer saves 10% on the order by applying a discount code is also in effect.

The `3T1free` rule is applied first, and Magento returns the price of a single shirt, $29, as the discount. Magento then applies a 10% discount to the remaining total of the products in the cart.

**Request:**

### Tier price example

In the following example, tier prices has been established for product `24-UG01` and `24-UG05`, as shown in the following table:

Product | Quantity | Fixed/Discount | Amount
--- | --- | --- | --- |
24-UG01 | 5 | Discount | 5%
24-UG01 | 10 | Discount | 10%
24-UG01 | 15 | Discount | 15%
24-UG05 | 5 | Fixed | $16
24-UG05 | 10 | Fixed | $11

The cart in the example contains 12 units of `24-UG05` and 8 units of `24-UG-01`, so the price of `24-UG05` is $11, and the price of `24-UG01` is $18.05 (5% off).
