The Sales module performs a wide variety of functions, including order, invoice, and shipment management. However, most of these functions are performed on the backend, and the customer does not have access to this information. By returning a list of customer orders, the `customerOrders` query allows a customer to retrieve their order histories.

Magento recommends you use customer tokens in the header of your GraphQL calls. However, you also can use [session authentication]({{ page.baseurl }}/get-started/authentication/gs-authentication-session.html).

## Syntax

`{customerOrders {CustomerOrders}}`

## Example usage

The following query returns the order history of the logged in customer.

**Request:**

```graphql
{
  customerOrders {
    items {
      increment_id
      id
      created_at
      grand_total
      status
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "customerOrders": {
      "items": [
        {
          "increment_id": "000000001",
          "id": 1,
          "created_at": "2019-02-21 00:24:34",

        },
        {
          "increment_id": "000000002",
          "id": 2,
          "created_at": "2019-02-21 00:24:35",
