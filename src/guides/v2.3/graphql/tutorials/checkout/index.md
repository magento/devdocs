This tutorial describes how to place an order through GraphQl. Customers can make purchases in two ways:

*  As a logged-in user
*  As a guest user who does not create an account

The **10-step tutorial** generally takes **30 minutes**.

The checkout process in GraphQl consists of 10 steps. Magento GraphQL is designed to run queries and perform actions on behalf of a customer. Magento GraphQL does not perform backend tasks, such as manage invoices or shipments.

### Before you begin

Complete the following prerequisites:

*  Install a Magento 2.3.2 instance with sample data.

  The sample data defines a functional store, called Luma, that sells fitness clothing and accessories. The store does not provide any sandbox accounts for testing credit card payments, so transactions will be simulated using an offline [payment method](https://glossary.magento.com/payment-method).

*  Install a GraphQl client. You can use any GraphQl client to send calls to Magento. [GraphiQL](https://electronjs.org/apps/graphiql) is recommended.

*  Learn about GraphQL, how it works, and how to use it. See [Introduction to GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) for details.

*  Know how to generate a customer token. See [Get customer authorization token]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/get-customer-authorization-token.html) for details.

*  Find the Magento Merchant documentation. Refer to [Getting Started with {{site.data.var.ce}}](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/getting-started.html) for information about the Luma store that is created when you install Magento with the sample data.
