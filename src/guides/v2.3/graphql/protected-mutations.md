title: Protected mutations
---

If CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA is enabled on pages requiring shopper input, then in most cases, the corresponding mutations that send requests to the Magento server must include an HTTP header that contains a value entered by the shopper (for CAPTCHA) or generated by the Google API (for reCAPTCHA). However, if you specify an integration authorization token in the header of the mutation, then you do not supply a header specific to CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA.

The HTTP `X-Captcha` and `X-ReCaptcha` headers:

*  Cannot be received by an automated script or a non-UI API call. They are captured and returned by the UI Web form only.
*  Is optional in protected mutation API calls that provide **_integration authorization_** tokens only. It cannot be skipped when you provide an Admin or Bearer token.

## CAPTCHA

The following table lists the forms that can be configured to require CAPTCHA. Go to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Customers** > **Customer Configuration** > **CAPTCHA** > **Forms** to enable or disable CAPTCHA on these forms.

The mutation that corresponds to a CAPTCHA-enabled form must include the HTTP `X-Captcha` header, along with the text the shopper entered in response to the CAPTCHA challenge.
