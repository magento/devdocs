title: deleteCustomerAddress mutation
---

Use the `deleteCustomerAddress` mutation to delete the specified customer address.

To return or modify information about a customer, Magento recommends you use customer tokens in the header of your GraphQL calls. However, you also can use [session authentication]({{ page.baseurl }}/get-started/authentication/gs-authentication-session.html).

## Syntax

`mutation: {deleteCustomerAddress(id: Int!) {Boolean}}`

## Example usage

The following call deletes a customer's address.

**Request:**

```graphql
mutation {
  deleteCustomerAddress(id: 4)
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "deleteCustomerAddress": true
  }
}
```

## Input attributes

The `deleteCustomerAddress` mutation requires the following input:

Attribute |  Data Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`id` | Int! | The ID assigned to the address object

## Output attributes

The `deleteCustomerAddress` mutation returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the operation was successful.

## Errors
