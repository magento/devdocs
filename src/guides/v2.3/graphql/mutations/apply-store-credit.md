title: applyStoreCreditToCart mutation
ee_only: true
---

The `applyStoreCreditToCart` mutation applies store credit to the specified cart. Store credit must be enabled on the store to run this mutation.

Store credit is an amount that the merchant applies to a customer account as a result of a refund or similar transaction. If gift cards are enabled for a store, then a customer receives store credit when redeeming a gift card. No matter how the customer obtains store credit, these funds can be used to pay for purchases.

The amount returned in the `current_balance` indicates how much store credit at the time you run the `applyStoreCreditToCart` mutation. This amount is not decreased until you place the order.

{:.bs-callout-info}
If the amount of available store credit equals or exceeds the grand total of the quote, set the payment method to `free` in the `setPaymentMethodOnCart` mutation.

## Syntax

`mutation: {applyStoreCreditToCart(input: ApplyStoreCreditToCartInput): {ApplyStoreCreditToCartOutput}}`

## Example usage

In the following example, the customer starts with $10 of store credit. The subtotal of the items in the cart before applying the store credit plus shipping and tax is $34.64. The grand total on the cart after applying the store credit is $24.64.
