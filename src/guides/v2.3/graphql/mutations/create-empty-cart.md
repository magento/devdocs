The `createEmptyCart` mutation creates an empty shopping cart for a guest or logged in customer. You can allow the system to generate a cart ID, or assign a specific ID.

If you are creating a cart for a logged in customer, you must include the customer's authorization token in the header of the request.

## Syntax

`mutation: {createEmptyCart}: String`

## Example usage

### Create a cart with a randomly-generated cart ID

**Request:**

```graphql
mutation {
  createEmptyCart
}
```

**Response:**

The response is the cart ID, which is sometimes called the quote ID. The remaining examples in this topic will use this cart ID.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createEmptyCart": "4JQaNVJokOpFxrykGVvYrjhiNv9qt31C"}
  }
}
```

### Create an empty cart with an assigned cart ID

You can also create an empty cart with a specified `cart_id`.

**Request:**

``` text
mutation {
  createEmptyCart(input:
     { cart_id: "x2345678901234567890123456789012"})
}
```

**Response:**

The mutation returns the same `cart_id`.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createEmptyCart": "x2345678901234567890123456789012"
  }
}
```
