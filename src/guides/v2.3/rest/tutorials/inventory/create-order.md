The [shopping cart](https://glossary.magento.com/shopping-cart) contains 71 items totaling $2462. The shipping charges are $350, making the grand total $2812. We're now ready to convert the [quote](https://glossary.magento.com/quote) to an order.

When you create an order, Magento enters reservations for the total amount of products. These reservations place a hold on that amount of inventory per stock, temporarily deducting the amount from the salable quantity. On the Products page of Admin, the **Salable Quantity** column accounts for reservations. When an order is shipped, Magento updates the quantities in the **Quantity per Source** column.

## Send payment information {#send-payment}

When you submit payment information, Magento creates an order and sends an order confirmation to the customer. Since we are using an offline [payment method](https://glossary.magento.com/payment-method) in this tutorial, we do not need to provide detailed payment information. The endpoint used in this example requires only the payment method and billing address information.

**Endpoint:**

`POST <host>/rest/us/V1/carts/mine/payment-information`

**Scope:**

`us` store view

**Headers:**

`Content-Type`: `application/json`

`Authorization`: `Bearer <customer token>`

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "paymentMethod": {
    "method": "banktransfer"
  },
  "billing_address": {
    "email": "jdoe@example.com",
    "region": "New York",
    "region_id": 43,
    "region_code": "NY",
    "country_id": "US",
    "street": ["123 Oak Ave"],
    "postcode": "10577",
    "city": "Purchase",
    "telephone": "512-555-1111",
    "firstname": "Jane",
    "lastname": "Doe"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

An `orderID`, such as `3`

## Verify this step {#verify-step}

1. Log in to the US store as the customer. The dashboard shows the order.
1. Log in to [Admin](https://glossary.magento.com/admin). Click **Sales** > **Orders**. The order is displayed in the grid. Its status is Pending.
1. Click **Catalog** > **Products**. The **Salable Quantity** column shows that fewer items of the ordered products are available. The values in the **Quantity per Source** are not affected until shipment.
