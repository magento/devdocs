An asynchronous web endpoint intercepts messages to a Web API and writes them to the message queue. Each time the system accepts such an API request, it generates a UUID identifier. Magento includes this UUID when it adds the message to the queue. Then, a consumer reads the messages from the queue and executes them one-by-one.

{:.bs-callout-tip}
Use the `bin/magento queue:consumers:start async.operations.all` command to start the consumer that handles asynchronous and bulk API messages.

Magento supports the following types of asynchronous requests:

*  POST
*  PUT
*  PATCH

{:.bs-callout-info}
GET and DELETE requests are not supported. Although Magento does not currently implement any PATCH requests, they are supported in custom extensions.

The route to all asynchronous calls contains the prefix `/async`, added before `/V1` of a standard synchronous endpoint. For example:

```http
POST /async/V1/products
PUT /async/V1/products/:sku
```

{{site.data.var.ce}} and {{site.data.var.ee}} installations support asynchronous web endpoints.

The [REST API documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/redoc/{{page.guide_version}}/) provides a list of all current synchronous Magento API routes.

The response of an asynchronous request contains the following fields:

Field name | Data type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`bulk_uuid` | String | A generated universally unique identifier.
`request_items` | Object | An array containing information about the status of the asynchronous request.
`id` | Integer | A generated ID that identifies the request.
`data_hash` | String | Reserved for future use. Currently, the value is always `null`.
`status` | String | Reserved for future use. Currently, the value is always `accepted`.
`errors` | Boolean | Reserved for future use. Currently, the value is always `false`. If an error occurs, the system provides all error-related information as a standard `webapi` exception.

## Sample usage

The following call asynchronously changes the price of the product that has a `sku` of `24-MB01`:

```http
PUT <host>/rest/<store_code>/async/V1/products/24-MB01
```

## Payload

```json
{
  "product": {
    "price": 29
  }
}
```

## Response

Magento generates a `bulk_uuid` for each asynchronous request. Use the `bulk_uuid` to determine the [operation status]({{ page.baseurl }}/rest/operation-status-endpoints.html) of your request.

```json
{
    "bulk_uuid": "fbfca270-7a90-4c4e-9f32-d6cf3728cdc7",
    "request_items": [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "data_hash": null,
            "status": "accepted"
        }
    ],
    "errors": false
}
```

## Store scopes

You can specify a store code in the route of an asynchronous endpoint so that it operates on a specific store, as shown below:

```http
POST /<store_code>/async/V1/products
PUT /<store_code>/async/V1/products/:sku
```

As a result, the asynchronous calls update the products on the specific store, instead of the default store.

You can specify the `all` store code to perform operations on all existing stores:

```http
POST /all/async/V1/products
PUT /all/async/V1/products/:sku
```

### Fallback and creating/updating objects when setting store scopes

The following rules apply when you create or update an object, such as a product.

*  If you do not set the store code while creating a new product, Magento creates a new object with all values set globally for each scope.
*  If you do not set the store code while updating a product, then by fallback, Magento updates values for the default store only.
*  If you include the `all` parameter, then Magento updates values for all store scopes (in case a particular store doesn't yet have its own value set).
*  If `<store_code>` parameter is set, then values for only defined store will be updated.
