title: Magento Commerce 2.3.1 Release Notes
---

*Release notes published on March 26, 2019 and last edited on August 16, 2019.*

We are pleased to present Magento Commerce 2.3.1.  This release includes over 200 functional fixes to the core product, over 500 pull requests contributed by the community, and  over 30 security enhancements.

This release includes significant contributions from our community members. These contributions range from minor clean-up of core code to the development of substantial features such as Inventory Management and GraphQL. Although code for these features is bundled with quarterly releases of the Magento core code, several of these projects (for example, Page Builder and Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Studio) are also released independently. Bug fixes for these projects are not documented in these core release notes but in separate project-specific sets of notes.

## Apply patch PRODSECBUG-2233 to address critical remote code execution vulnerability (RCE)

An unauthenticated cross-site scripting vulnerability combined with an authenticated Phar deserialization vulnerability has left this version of Magento Commerce open to serious exploit. An attacker can use these vulnerabilities to inject JavaScript into the Magento Admin and subsequently launch malicious code in a store user’s browser.   **We strongly recommend that all users of the affected versions of Magento download and apply the appropriate patch as soon as possible**.

This issue and the available patches are discussed in the [Extending the June 25 Security Update to Older Versions of Magento](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Extending-the-June-25-Security-Update-to-Older-Versions-of/ba-p/138231)
blog post. You can directly access patch code through your Magento account for Magento Commerce. Locate the patch by the name. We provide both Git-based and Composer-based patches.

## Apply the Scope parameter for Async/Bulk API patch to address an issue with the Async/Bulk REST API

In certain versions of Magento Open Source and Magento Commerce, the Asynchronous and Bulk REST endpoints support the default store view scope only. After this patch is applied to deployments running those versions of Magento, the current Magento message queue implementation
will factor in the store that executes queue operations. See [Patch for Magento Framework Message Queue and Store Scopes](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Patch-for-Magento-Framework-Message-Queue-and-Store-Scopes/ba-p/135209) for a full discussion of this scope-related issue and patch contents. See [Applying patches]({{ page.baseurl }}/comp-mgr/patching.html) for specific instructions on downloading and applying Magento patches. To apply the patch, navigate to the [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches), and select the patch associated with the version of Magento you are running.

## Apply the PRODSECBUG-2198 patch to address critical SQL injection vulnerability

A critical SQL injection vulnerability has been identified in 2.3.x Magento code. A fix for this issue is included in Magento 2.3.1. If you cannot immediately apply the full patch, you can quickly protect your store from this vulnerability by installing patch PRODSECBUG-2198.  However, **we strongly encourage all merchants to stay up-to-date on security patches**. See the description of  PRODSECBUG-2198  in the  [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-2.3.1-2.2.8-and-2.1.17-security-update) for information on this vulnerability.

Follow these steps to download and apply this patch:

1. Access [My Account](https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login).

1. Navigate to the **Downloads** tab. Select the Magento edition and version you need.

1. Select **Support Patches and Security Patches**, then **PRODSECBUG-2198**.

1. Download the patch and upload to a specific directory in your Magento installation such as `m2-hotfixes` (confirm  that the directory is not accessible publicly).

1. From your project root, apply the patch.  `git apply ./m2-hotfixes/<patch-file-name>`.

1. Refresh the cache from the Admin (**System** > **Cache Management**).

## PayPal Payflow Pro active carding activity update

The PayPal Payflow Pro integration in Magento is being actively targeted by carding activity. To resolve these carding activity issues, Magento has provided Composer packages that add an option for Google reCAPTCHA and CAPTCHA to the Payflow Pro checkout form. See [PayPal Payflow Pro active carding activity](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025515991) for a full discussion of this issue and instructions on downloading these packages. **We strongly recommend that all Payflow Pro merchants download and install these packages to help enhance the security of their storefronts**.

## Apply the Admin Dashboard Image-Charts patch to address deprecation of Google Image Charts

Magento 2.x currently uses Google Image Charts to render static charts in Admin dashboards. Google stopped supporting Google Image Charts on March 14, 2019, and Magento is providing the Admin Dashboard Image-Charts  patch to replace Google Image Charts with the Image-Charts free service. Users of Magento 2.x deployments will not be able to view static charts in Magento 2.x instances unless they download and apply this patch.

See  [Switch from deprecated Google Image Charts to Image-Charts for Magento](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024850172) for information on downloading and applying this patch.

## Highlights

Look for the following highlights in this release:

### Merchant tool enhancements

#### Page Builder

Page Builder is a drag-and-drop visual content editing tool that lets merchants customize content page layout and create shopping experiences that blend content and commerce without writing HTML or CSS.  Page Builder provides merchants with a powerful set of content types to compose various types of pages and easy drag-and-drop positioning of all content elements for intuitive page editing. Page Builder is available on Magento Commerce only. See [Page Builder User Guide](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/cms/page-builder.html) and [Page Builder Developer Documentation](https://devdocs.magento.com/page-builder/docs/index.html).

#### Improved order creation workflow in the Admin

The Admin order creation workflow has been refactored to eliminate delays when editing billing and shipping addresses. Processing of these fields now happens only after they are populated.

#### Ability to upload PDP images without compression and downsizing

 Merchants can now upload PDP images larger than 1920 x 1200  without first compressing and downsizing the images. Previously, when a merchant uploaded a high quality product image (larger than 1920 x 1200), Magento resized and compressed the image. Merchants can now set requirements for resizing and compression as well as compression quality and target width and height. <!--- MAGETWO-95299-->

#### Inventory Management 1.1.0 (Community-developed feature!)

The Magento Inventory (was MSI) community project has added multiple new features to this release of Inventory Management. See [Inventory Management Release Notes]({{ page.baseurl }}/inventory/release-notes.html) for information about specific fixes and acknowledgements to community contributors.

*  **Support for Elasticsearch and Inventory Management**. All site searches now return correct products and quantities when Elasticsearch is used as the search engine. (As of this release, only default option from 2.3+)  Searches return results from stock assigned to the website. Advanced features are supported, including filtering search results. Community-developed feature!

*  **Distance Priority Source Selection algorithm (SSA) option**. Merchants can enable this algorithm to reduce fulfillment costs by shipping orders from the closest inventory locations. This SSA option uses address geocoding through the Google Maps API to calculate the shortest distance for deliveries. See [Manage source selection algorithms]({{ page.baseurl }}/rest/modules/inventory/manage-source-selection.html).

*  **Enhancements to mass inventory transfers**. Bulk transfer of inventory has been optimized to improve processing speed and to reduce locking during transfers.

### Improved developer experience

#### Progressive Web Apps (PWA) Studio

PWA Studio is a set of developer tools that allow you to develop, deploy, and maintain a PWA storefront on top of Magento 2.x. See [Magento PWA Documentation](https://magento.github.io/pwa-studio/).

#### GraphQL

Community contributions for this release include major additions to cart actions (create cart, populate cart, set shipping address)  and customers (create customer account). See [Release Notes]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/release-notes.html) for information about specific fixes and acknowledgements to community contributors.

### Substantial security enhancements

This release includes over 30 security enhancements that help close cross-site scripting, arbitrary code execution, and sensitive data disclosure vulnerabilities as well as other security issues. No confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. See [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-2.3.1-2.2.8-and-2.1.17-security-update) for a comprehensive discussion of these issues. All exploitable security issues fixed in this release (2.3.1) have been ported to 2.2.8, 2.1.17, 1.14.4.1, and 1.9.4.1, as appropriate.

### Performance boosts

**Magento now supports customer accounts with more than 3,000 addresses**. B2B merchants should note the multiple code enhancements that contribute to this performance boost:

*  Customer address handling has been rewritten with UI components that increase platform performance, which in turn streamlines the management of customers with 3000 and more addresses.  <!--- MAGETWO-94346 95249-->

*  The Admin order creation page now handles  customer accounts with 3000 addresses without performance issues. <!--- MC-5683-->

*  Magento now displays the list of additional customer addresses contained in the storefront customer address book  as a grid, which has improved performance for customers with many additional addresses associated with their accounts. [Address Book](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/customers/account-dashboard-address-book.html) describes how to use this enhanced feature. <!--- MAGETWO-94347-->

*  The shipping and billing data that a user enters during checkout now persists if the user interrupts checkout to continue shopping. Previously, checkout data was deleted after a cart update. <!-- MAGETWO-95067 -->

### Infrastructure improvements

Infrastructure improvements are core enhancements that underlie both merchant and developer features.

*  This release includes a **new Authorize.Net extension** to replace the Authorize.Net Direct Post module, which implemented an MD5-based hash that Authorize.Net will no longer support as of June 28, 2019. See [Authorize.Net](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/payment/authorize-net.html) for information on configuring and using this new extension. Information about the deprecation of Authorize.Net Direct Post can be found [here](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/payment/authorize-net-direct-post.html). Note that Magento released a patch in late February to address this issue on pre-2.3.1 installations of Magento, which is discussed in [Update Authorize.Net Direct Post from MD5 to SHA-512](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024368392-Update-Authorize-Net-Direct-Post-from-MD5-to-SHA-512).

*  Accept.js library is now used for Authorize.NET payments.

*  Magento now supports **Elasticsearch 6.x**. *Fix submitted by community member  Romain Ruaud in pull request [21458](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21458)*. Thank you, Romain! <!--- ENGCOM-4389 -->

*  Update PayPal Express Checkout to `checkout.js v4`. This introduces a modernized checkout flow, faster checkout performance, and new payment options in a single integration that does not have to be updated as new payment methods become available. It also unlocks new payment options including Venmo and PayPal Credit. See [PayPal Express Checkout](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/payment/paypal-express-checkout.html).

*  Magento now supports **Redis 5.0**. <!--- MC-5201 -->

*  Magento support for PHP has changed slightly as a result of expanding our Elasticsearch support in this release. Magento 2.3.1 is compatible with PHP 7.2.x  and certified  on PHP 7.2.11.

*  You can now isolate and extract MySQL Views from regular database tables with no negative effects on database backup and restoration. Support for MySQL Views was introduced in 2.3.0 with unexpected consequences to the default database backups and restore mechanism. This fix restores expected  backup and restore functionality while preserving MySQL View support the backward compatibility with legacy inventory. *Fix submitted by community member  Stepan Furman in pull request [21151](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21151)*. Thank you, Stepan!

*  Magento now uses version 6.0 of the DHL XML Services schema for the DHL shipping method. <!--- MC-4245-->

*  <!--- MAGETWO-95068-->Checkout information now persists after a cart update**. Information previously entered by a customer during check out (such as shipping address) now persists after the customer updates their shopping cart. Previously, when a customer updated their shopping cart, all information previously entered during check out (such as shipping address) was deleted.

*  Upgrade of Magento Functional Test Framework (MFTF) to 2.3.13.

### Bundled extension enhancements

This release of Magento includes extensions developed by third-party vendors.

#### Amazon Pay

*  Added **multi-currency support** for  EU and U.K. merchants. See [Use multi-currency](https://amzn.github.io/amazon-payments-magento-2-plugin/configuration.html#use-multi-currency) for an introduction to using this new feature with Magento 2.x.  <!--- BUNDLE-1762-->

#### dotdigital Engagement Cloud (formerly dotmailer)

*  dotmailer has been rebranded as dotdigital Engagement Cloud.

*  Support for Marketing preferences has been added to the customer account dashboard area.

*  If enabled, we now display the customer consent text in the customer's account dashboard area as the general subscription text.

*  The abandoned cart and automation process now benefits from a retry function if contacts are pending in dotdigital Engagement Cloud.

#### Magento Shipping

New features for Magento 2.3.1 include:

*  **Shipment Cancellation**.  You can now cancel a shipment that has not yet been dispatched by accessing the shipment and clicking **Cancel Shipment**.

*  **Carrier Specific Packaging**. Carrier-specific packaging has been added for FedEx. These packages will be available for selection during shipping if a FedEx carrier is configured.

*  **Qualification Experience**. The three Qualification experiences (Ship to Address, Click & Collect, and Collection Points) have been restructured and are now available as outcomes in a single Qualification experience.

*  **Security**. We've closed scenarios that could allow for third-party code execution.

## Fixed issues

We've fixed hundreds of issues in the Magento 2.3.1 core code.

### Installation, upgrade, deployment

<!--- MC-6275 -->

*  The commands to enable and disable debug logging have changed to `bin/magento setup:config:set --enable-debug-logging=true | false`. The previous commands, `bin/magento config:set dev/debug/debug_logging 0 | 1` are no longer supported.  See [Logging]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/cli/logging.html).

<!--- ENGCOM-3291 -->

*  Magento now sets the `id_prefix` option on prefix cache keys for the cache frontend during installation. If this option is not set, Magento uses the first 12 bits of the md5 hash of the absolute path to the Magento `app/etc` directory. But if this value is not exactly the same on all web servers, cache invalidation will not work.  *Fix submitted by Fabian Schmengler in pull request [18641](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18641)*. [GitHub-15828](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15828)

<!--- ENGCOM-3059 -->

*  The `./bin/magento config:show` command no longer fails with a fatal error after you run `./bin/magento app:config:dump`. *Fix submitted by Pratik Oza in pull request [18295](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18295)*. [GitHub-17582](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17582)

<!--- ENGCOM-3160 -->

*  The `getHostUrl()` method has been updated to reference `HTTP_HOST` rather than `SERVER_PORT`. *Fix submitted by Logan Stellway in pull request [18393](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18393)*. [GitHub-18131](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18131)

<!--- MAGETWO-96107 -->

*  Magento no longer displays an extraneous blank option in the country drop-down menu.

<!--- MAGETWO-91764 -->

*  Excessive timeouts no longer result from the discrepancy between storefront and Admin uses of HTTPS. The storefront now  uses HTTPS exclusively while the Admin uses HTTP.

<!--- ENGCOM-3786 -->

*  The `config:set --lock-config` command  now acts as expected on all scopes. Previously, after this command was run, administrators were not able to change the configuration for the default store, but could still change it for other scopes. *Fix submitted by Mahesh Singh in pull request [19880](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19880)*. [GitHub-19609](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19609)

<!--- MC-1364-->

*  The **Allow Dynamic Media URLs in Products and Categories** configuration setting, which was previously accessed from **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Catalog** > **Storefront**, has been removed. The **Use Static URLs for Media Content in WYSIWYG** setting (**Stores** > **Configuration** > **General** > **Content management** > **WYSIWYG Options**) now applies to any media URLs that are entered through the WYSIWYG editor.

### AdminGWS

<!--- MAGETWO-91617 -->

*  Magento now updates the reports table as expected when a new administrator with restricted privileges logs in and selects **Report** > **Products** > **Ordered**. Previously, Magento did not generate this report, and logged an error in `var/log/system.log`.

### Analytics

<!--- ENGCOM-3263  -->

*  You can now save configuration settings from the **Admin**  > **Stores** > **Configuration** > **General** > **Advanced Reporting** without providing an industry value. Previously, Magento did not save configuration settings, and displayed this error:  `Please select a vertical.` *Fix submitted by Pratik Oza in pull request [18782](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18782)*. [GitHub-15259](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15259)

### Authorization

<!--- MAGETWO-95536 -->

*  You can now successfully save a role from the Admin. Previously, when you saved a role from the Admin, Magento removed all  users from the role (no matter which checkbox was checked), and displayed this message, `This user has no tokens`.

### Backend

<!--- ENGCOM-4054 -->

*  The **Reload Data** button on the Admin now works as expected. *Fix submitted by Eduard Chitora in pull request [20803](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20803)*. [GitHub-20802](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20802)

### Bundle

<!--- ENGCOM-3361  -->

*  Bundle special prices are now correctly rounded when you load and resave a bundle product. Previously, when you reloaded a bundle with a special price that required four positions after the decimal (for example, 78,9473), Magento rounded the price to two decimal places. *Fix submitted by p-bystritsky in pull request [18987](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18987)*. [GitHub-17638](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17638)

<!--- ENGCOM-3391  -->

[GitHub-18979](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18979)

<!--- ENGCOM-3161 MAGETWO-69959  -->

*  Magento no longer overwrites user-defined option quantities with default values when a customer edits a bundle product from a shopping cart. *Fix submitted by Vishal Gelani in pull request [18520](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18520)*. [GitHub-4942](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/4942)

<!--- MAGETWO-58212 -->

*  You can now successfully change the attribute set for a bundle product. Previously, the edit bundle page hung, and Magento threw this error, `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined`. [GitHub-5999](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/5999)

<!--- MAGETWO-91628 -->

*  Magento now maintains the correct base price for a bundle product when you add a bundle product in one currency and then add the same bundle product option in a different currency. Previously, when you added the same bundle product option in a different currency, Magento doubled the base price.

<!--- MAGETWO-91679 -->

*  Bundle product SKUs are now built based on the order of the options set in the bundle product.  Previously, SKUs were built based on the order of the selected product ID numbers in ascending order. [GitHub-14262](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14262)

<!--- ENGCOM-3487 3585 -->

*  Magento now adds all selected values to the cart when a customer adds a bundle product option using an input type checkbox. Previously, if a bundle product had three values, Magento added only two options to the cart. *Fix submitted by Mahesh Singh in pull request [19261](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19261) and pull request [19437](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19437)*. [GitHub-19205](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19205)

[GitHub-19509](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19509)

<!--- MAGETWO-97617 -->

*  You can now add a bundle product to a requisition list from the category page. Previously, Magento threw this error, `PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to a member function getParentProductId() on string in app/code/Magento/RequisitionList/Model/RequisitionListItem/Options/Builder.php:118`.

### B2B

<!--- MAGETWO-91614 -->

<!--- MAGETWO-94866 -->

*  Magento now displays products that merchants have added to the public catalog through **Product** > **Edit page** > **Shared Catalog**. Previously, these items appeared if added  through **Catalog** > **Shared Catalog**, but not through **Product** > **Edit page** > **Shared Catalog**.

<!--- MAGETWO-91661 -->

*  Menus now close as expected from the Quick Order page in mobile view.

<!--- MAGETWO-94887 -->

<!--- MAGETWO-97314 -->

*  Magento now displays custom prices in quotes, the shopping cart, and during checkout. Previously, when you moved a product with a custom price to the shopping cart from the Admin, the custom price was lost, and Magento did not display it in the shopping cart.

<!--- MAGETWO-97131 -->

*  A logged-in user can now log out, log in as a guest, and then check out when persistent cart is enabled. Previously, under these circumstances, the customer logged in as guest could not check out, and Magento displayed this error, `No such entity with cartId = null`.

<!--- MAGETWO-97315 -->

*  Magento now correctly displays pricing for configurable products when permissions are set to prevent adding products to cart from a category.

### CAPTCHA

<!--- MAGETWO-94052 -->

### Cart and checkout

<!--- ENGCOM-3194  -->

*  Magento now displays a product's special price on the storefront, product listings, and product detail page as expected when the special price is 0.00. Previously, Magento displayed the regular price, but used the special price for sorting and quote calculations. *Fix submitted by Mahesh Singh in pull request [18631](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18631)*. [GitHub-18268](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18268)

<!--- ENGCOM-3073  -->

*  Magento no longer displays the infinite loading indicator when an error occurs during check out. *Fix submitted by Ihor Sviziev in pull request [18331](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18331)*. [GitHub-18330](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18330)

<!--- ENGCOM-3189  -->

*  The **Clear shopping cart** button now works as expected. Previously, the page reloaded, but the shopping cart was not cleared. *Fix submitted by Luuk Schakenraad in pull request [18596](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18596)*. [GitHub-18475](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18475), [GitHub-18589](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18589)

<!--- ENGCOM-2987  -->

*  Magento now dispatches a `checkout_cart_product_add_before` event in addition to a `checkout_cart_product_add_after` event. *Fix submitted by Leandro Rosa in pull request [18080](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18080)*. [GitHub-17830](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17830)

<!--- MAGETWO-95935 -->

*  Customer address attribute validation during checkout now permits spaces.

<!--- MAGETWO-96812 -->

*  Clicking multiple times on the mini cart icon no longer logs out the current customer. Previously, when a logged-in customer added a product to the cart and then clicked the shopping cart icon multiple times, Magento displayed an empty shopping cart and logged out the customer.

<!--- ENGCOM-3136 -->

*  You can now successfully save products  with SKU lengths that are less than or equal to 64 digits. Previously, Magento threw a fatal error when you tried to re-save a child product after reducing the length of its 64-digit-long SKU. *Fix submitted by Thiago in pull request [18462](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18462)*. [GitHub-18082](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18082)

<!--- ENGCOM-3546 -->

*  Translations for `tier_price.phtml` now work as expected. Previously, these translations were not included in `js-translation.json` and were not visible on the storefront. *Fix submitted by Oleksii Gorbulin in pull request [19094](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19094)*. [GitHub-19085](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19085)

<!--- MAGETWO-96364 -->

### cron

<!--- ENGCOM-3062  -->

*  A new `cron.log` file dedicated to logging cron-related information has been added to Magento. This new log file reduces output previously sent to the `system.log` file, making it easier to find non-cron-related information in the `system.log` file.  *Fix submitted by Pieter Hoste in pull request [18209](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18209)*. [GitHub-17190](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17190)

### Customers

<!--- ENGCOM-3390 -->

*  We've added an additional check for the password hash for  customers that have been created from the Admin without a password. Previously, customers created this way could not log in. *Fix submitted by Yevhenii Dumskyi in pull request [19066](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19066)*. [GitHub-19060](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19060)

<!--- ENGCOM-3351 -->

*  Magento now displays the same order total in  the customer information orders grid and orders grid when an order is placed in a currency other than the base currency. Previously, Magento displayed the wrong order total in the Admin's customer information orders tab. *Fix submitted by Anuj Gupta in pull request [18650](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18650)*. [GitHub-18618](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18618)

<!--- ENGCOM-3372 -->

*  Magento no longer displays the forgot password form while a customer is logged in but instead directs the customer to the customer dashboard. *Fix submitted by Oleksii Gorbulin in pull request [19026](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19026)*. [GitHub-18256](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18256)

<!--- ENGCOM-3387 -->

*  The reset password link in the password reset mail sent to customers when they click **Reset password** on the login page now permits customers to reset their password as expected.  *Fix submitted by p-bystritsky in pull request [19026](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19026)*. [GitHub-18256](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18256)

<!--- ENGCOM-3014 -->

*  Magento now maintains alphabetical order for customer groups when you filter customers by group in the Admin.  Previously, groups were sorted by ID. *Fix submitted by Dmytro Cheshun in pull request [18117](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18117)*. [GitHub-18101](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18101)

<!--- ENGCOM-3068 -->

*  Merchants can now edit a customer account if the customer's password has expired. *Fix submitted by Dmytro Cheshun in pull request [18308](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18308)*. [GitHub-18162](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18162)

<!--- MAGETWO-95692 -->

*  Magento now displays the value of a custom customer address attribute  in the column for that attribute when you create a custom customer address attribute and set it to be displayed in the Columns list.  Previously, Magento added the customer code column to the Customer table, but left these columns blank.

<!--- MAGETWO-91704 -->

*  You can now change payment methods after selecting store credit when creating an order from the Admin.

<!--- MAGETWO-91644 -->

*  Customers can now be matched in customer segments based on the number of orders in a multi-site deployment.

<!--- MAGETWO-95925 -->

*  We've improved the performance of the customer segment rule, which has improved site performance.

<!--- MAGETWO-96007 -->

*  Magento no longer unchecks the default billing and shipping address checkboxes when you create or update a customer address using the API.

<!--- MAGETWO-94347 -->

*  Magento now displays the list of additional customer addresses that are contained in the storefront customer address book  as a grid, which has improved performance for customers with many additional addresses associated with their accounts.

<!--- MAGETWO-91720-->

*  When a customer uses a gift card to make a purchase, Magento now applies only the applicable amount to the invoice. Previously, the total amount of the gift card was applied to a customer's store credit for a partial invoice.

<!--- MAGETWO-97397-->

*  Magento now assigns new accounts in multisite deployments  to the customer group that is associated with the default website scope. Previously, a new customer created from the Admin  had their customer group set to the default customer group on the default website scope.

<!--- ENGCOM-3056 -->

*  Customers who have an address associated with a country that has not been set to **allowed** can now successfully reset their password. *Fix submitted by Dmytro Cheshun in pull request [18179](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18179)*. [GitHub-18170](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18170)

<!--- ENGCOM-4028 -->

*  Removed an unneeded space from the title of the My Account page in mobile view. *Fix submitted by Amol Chaudhari in pull request [20725](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20725)*. [GitHub-20723](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20723)

<!--- ENGCOM-3981 -->

*  Removed an empty block on the My Account page sidebar. *Fix submitted by Pratik Oza in pull request [20630](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20630)*. [GitHub-19139](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19139)

<!--- MAGETWO-97411 -->

*  The `Magento\Customer\Model\Customer::getDataModel` method has been optimized, which has reduced the time required to load customer accounts with many addresses.

<!--- MAGETWO-98183 -->

*  **State/Province** field values are no longer required when creating an order from the Admin. Previously, Magento indicated that **State/Province** field values were required even though configuration settings indicated that these values were not required.

<!--- ENGCOM-4063 -->

*  Magento now respects the number of lines permitted in a street address as set in  **Store** > **Configuration** > **Customer** > **Customer Configuration** > **Name and Address Options**. Previously, Magento displayed the last saved values instead of the default value. *Fix submitted by Ievgenii Gryshkun in pull request [20565](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20565)*. [GitHub-13675](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13675)

<!--- ENGCOM-3368 -->

*  Images can now by default be successfully imported from HTTP and redirected to HTTPS. Previously, the image could not be uploaded. *Fix submitted by Rahul Mahto in pull request [18900](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18900)*. [GitHub-18839](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18839)

### Customer attributes

<!--- MAGETWO-96845 -->

*  Magento now loads the customer attribute page as expected, and users can edit attributes, when attributes are set to default values. Previously, Magento did not completely load this page when attributes values were set to default.

<!--- MAGETWO-70968 -->

*  Custom customer address attributes can now be updated when you edit an order's billing address in the Admin.

<!--- MAGETWO-91659 -->

*  You can now create a customer without a phone number when **Show Telephone** is set to optional. Previously, Magento displayed an informative error message and did not let you create the customer.

<!--- ENGCOM-3181 -->

*  Magento now saves  custom customer attributes as expected when  EAV caching is disabled.  Previously, directly saving customer information resulted in data loss. *Fix submitted by Vishal Gelani in pull request [18571](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18571)*. [GitHub-12479](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12479)

### Dashboard

<!--- MAGETWO-95299 -->

*  You can now upload PDP images larger than 1920 x 1200  without compressing and downsizing the images first. Previously, when a merchant uploaded a high quality product image (larger than 1920 X 1200), Magento resized and compressed the image. Merchants can now set requirements for resizing and compression as well as compression quality and target width and height.

<!--- MAGETWO-96975 -->

*  `_sleep` and `__wakeup` have been removed, and a new `PHP.MD` rule has been added to discourage PHP serialization.

<!--- ENGCOM-3857 -->

*  Magento now validates new addresses when created from the address book telephone field on the My Account dashboard page. *Fix submitted by Dipti in pull request [20262](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20262)*. [GitHub-20261](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20261)

### Developer

<!--- ENGCOM-3364 -->

*  Email messages sent from the command line (where the email loads into another block) can now be sent successfully. *Fix submitted by p-bystritsky in pull request [18988](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18988)*. [GitHub-10440](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10440)

### Directory

<!--- ENGCOM-4114 -->

*  The Swagger definition for `eav-data-attribute-option-interface` has been corrected. Previously, when you created a REST call to an endpoint that returns an object of `eav-data-attribute-option-interface` and `is_default` is set to `true`, `is_default` returns an object instead of the expected Boolean. *Fix submitted by Hiren Patel in pull request [20913](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20913)*. [GitHub-18525](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18525)

<!--- ENGCOM-4165 -->

*  `crontab` now updates all currency rates daily  as expected. Previously, crontab updated only a subset of the enabled currencies. *Fix submitted by Denis Papec in pull request [18981](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18981)*. [GitHub-18580](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18580)

### Downloadable

<!--- ENGCOM-3384 -->

*  The order confirmation email sent when a guest checks out now includes download links as expected. *Fix submitted by Oleksandr Kravchuk in pull request [19040](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19040)*. [GitHub-18323](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18323), [GitHub-19003](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19003), [GitHub-19034](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19034)

<!--- MAGETWO-91711 -->

*  You can now delete downloadable product links without first deleting sample links.

### EAV

<!--- ENGCOM-3236 -->

*  You can now use the `OptionManagement.delete` method to programmatically delete a product attribute that converts to false. Previously, Magento threw an exception. *Fix submitted by Patrick McLain in pull request [18720](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18720)*. [GitHub-13083](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13083)

<!--- MAGETWO-94848 -->

*  You can now use an attribute set on the product create page after moving the attributes from one attribute group to another.

<!--- ENGCOM-3814 -->

*  The customer EAV decimal attribute now accepts a value of 0. *Fix submitted by Shikha Mishra in pull request [20130](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20130)*. [GitHub-20030](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20030)

<!--- ENGCOM-3797 -->

*  The Magento storefront now correctly displays products with a custom attribute of type  `Media Image`. *Fix submitted by David Verholen in pull request [20096](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20096)*. [GitHub-19054](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19054)

<!--- ENGCOM-3045 -->

*  Magento no longer changes the `source_model` when you create an attribute option through the API. Previously, the `source_model` of an EAV attribute was set to `Magento\Eav\Model\Entity\Attribute\Source\Table` when updating an EAV attribute's options through the API. This eliminated the ability to update this attribute's options through the Admin. *Fix submitted by Pieter Hoste in pull request [18244](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18244)*. [GitHub-13156](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13156)

<!--- ENGCOM-3124 -->

*  Magento no longer throws an SQL Join error when you use a custom EAV entity  with the `standard eav_entity` entity table. Previously, this usage resulted in an integrity constraint violation. *Fix submitted by Roman Strelenko in pull request [18437](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18437)*. [GitHub-18131](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18131)

### Email

<!--- MAGETWO-95137 -->

*  The return path e-mail variable `system/smtp/return_path_email` now works as expected.

<!--- ENGCOM-3744 -->

*  Email subject headers now support UTF-8 encoding. *Fix submitted by Alexey Varlamov in pull request [19978](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19978)*. [GitHub-19977](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19977)

### Frameworks

<!--- MAGETWO-97040 -->

*  Magento no longer logs an error when you include properly escaped special characters in store view names. Previously, Magento logged errors in the `exception.log`.

<!--- MAGETWO-96342 -->

*  Magento now attempts to reconnect when a MySQL timeout occurs. Previously, Magento displayed an informative PHP-related message and did not attempt to reconnect.

<!--- MAGETWO-94089 -->

*  You can now set all products that currently have **Set Product as New** set to **yes** set to **no**. This change affects bulk updates, CSV imports, and scheduled updates.

<!--- MAGETWO-95838 -->

*  Attributes in flat tables are now updated after the product is saved when the catalog product flat index is turned on and the indexer is set to **Save on Update**.

<!--- ENGCOM-3538 -->

*  `dev/tools/grunt/configs/themes.js` has been removed from the `.gitignore` file and added to the GitHub repository. Previously, `localthemes.js` was included in  `.gitignore` and replaced during a Magento update. *Fix submitted by [Torben Höhn](https://github.com/torhoehn) in pull request [19350](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19350)*. [GitHub-18949](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18949)

<!--- ENGCOM-3295 -->

*  Magento now autoloads vendor root folders and can now run with custom Composer vendor directories. Previously, Magento's autoloader registration failed to generate the correct path when using the `COMPOSER_VENDOR_DIR` setting to specify a vendor path outside of the Magento installation root. *Fix submitted by [Rus0](https://github.com/Rus0) in pull request [18849](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18849)*. [GitHub-17753](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17753)

<!--- ENGCOM-3471 -->

*  Newly added links on the customer dashboard are now shown as current when the link path has been constructed from both default and new elements. Previously, the link was added, but not shown in the current state as expected. *Fix submitted by [Eduard Chitoraga](https://github.com/eduard13) in pull request [19134](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19134)*. [GitHub-19099](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19099)

<!--- ENGCOM-3483 -->

*  The `fileUploader` form element in the  `ui_component` form now works as expected. Previously, during file upload, the countable interface was not implemented, and Magento threw this error, `Error Message : Warning: count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable`.  *Fix submitted by [gmachure](https://github.com/gmachure) in pull request [19249](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19249)*. [GitHub-19247](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19247)

<!--- ENGCOM-3243 -->

*  Interception cache compilation has been improved, and custom profiler records are now executed in less than a second. Previously, profiled methods consumed about 70% of the first page load after `cache:flush` from either the command-line interface or the Admin. *Fix submitted by Patrick McLain in pull request [18648](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18648)*. [GitHub-17680](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17680)

<!--- ENGCOM-3535 -->

*  `Magento\Framework\Webapi\Rest\Response\Renderer` class's  `_formatValue` method has been refactored to handle ampersands correctly. Previously, an ampersand in any customer text field when using the  web API doubled the encoding. [GitHub-18361](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18361)

<!--- ENGCOM-3846 -->

*  Deprecated interface `\Magento\Framework\Option\ArrayInterface` has been replaced with `\Magento\Framework\Data\OptionSourceInterface` in `lib/internal/Magento/Framework/Option/ArrayPool.php`. *Fix submitted by Milind Singh in pull request [20248](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20248)*. [GitHub-20064](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20064)

<!--- ENGCOM-4166 -->

*  Corrected invalid return type in docblock in `Magento\Framework\HTTP\PhpEnvironment\Request::getHeader()`. Previously, the docblock of the  `Magento\Framework\HTTP\PhpEnvironment\Request::getHeader()` method stated that it would return a `bool` or an instance of `Zend\Http\Header\HeaderInterface()`. However, this method returned either a `bool` or a `string`. *Fix submitted by Milind Singh in pull request [21035](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/21035)*. [GitHub-21034](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21034)

<!--- ENGCOM-3117 -->

*  Magento now throws `LogicException($message, 0, $e)` instead of `LogicException($message)` as needed when running validation for communication configuration (`communication.xml`).  Previously, the  validator in `Magento\Framework\Communication\Config\Validator` did not propagate exceptions, which obscured the cause of the error. *Fix submitted by Artsiom Bruneuski in pull request [18416](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18416)*. [GitHub-14555](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14555)

<!--- ENGCOM-4073 -->

*  JavaScript translation issues on the modal buttons that Magento displays when removing items from the product compare page have been resolved. *Fix submitted by Max Fickers in pull request [20109](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20109)*. [GitHub-19705](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19705)

<!--- ENGCOM-4046 -->

*  We've added support for `use` statements in web API interfaces and the use of non-FQN class names in `doctypes`. Previously,  you could not  import class names in interfaces that were used for the web API. *Fix submitted by Riccardo Tempesta in pull request [17424](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/17424)*. [GitHub-1537](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/1537)

<!--- ENGCOM-3710 -->

*  `Magento/Framework/HTTP/Adapter/Curl.php` now supports setting an HTTP version. *Fix submitted by SikailoISM in pull request [19845](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19845)*. [GitHub-19442](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19442)

<!--- ENGCOM-3425 -->

*  Magento can now read responses from third-party servers that use HTTP/2 if your server also uses HTTP/2. Previously, this inability to read requests from third-party servers that use HTTP/2 prevented access to Magento Marketplace.  *Fix submitted by Vova Yatsyuk in pull request [19143](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19143)*. [GitHub-19127](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19127)

<!--- ENGCOM-3753 -->

*  The AMQP helper has been updated to use host, username, and password configuration from the instance under test. This allows tests to run when the AMQP service is not using default credentials or available on `localhost`. Previously, the `host` value in this helper was hardcoded. *Fix submitted by Patrick McLain in pull request [18978](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18978)*. [GitHub-18953](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18953)

#### Cache framework

<!--- MAGETWO-64282 -->

*  Problems with cache-cleaning for product pages for simple  products that are associated with configurable products  have been resolved. and as a result, product pages now accurately display out-of-stock status.  Previously, when an associated product went out-of-stock, Magento did not update the product page of the configurable product unless you cleaned the cache. [GitHub-8009](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8009)

<!--- MAGETWO-95853 -->

*  The images cache can now be flushed from the Admin (**Admin** > **System** > **Cache Management** and click **Flush Catalog Images Cache**). Previously, you could not delete the directory, and Magento displayed an error on the cache management page.

<!--- MAGETWO-91694 -->

*  Magento now removes disabled products as expected from the flat product table when **Catalog Flat Product** is enabled.

#### Configuration framework

<!--- MAGETWO-97247 -->

*  You can now enable shared catalogs using the `config:set` command. Previously, this command enabled the shared catalog but did not create the necessary permissions to access it.

#### Data framework

<!--- ENGCOM-3268 -->

*  Class `\Magento\Framework\Data\Form\Element\Fieldset` now calls the `getBeforeElementHtml` method. *Fix submitted by Burlacu Vasilii in pull request [18798](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18798)*. [GitHub-2618](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/2618)

#### Event framework

<!--- ENGCOM-3422 -->

*  `events.xml` can now have child nodes. *Fix submitted by Lisovyi Yevhenii in pull request [19146](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19146)*. [GitHub-15931](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15931)

#### JavaScript framework

<!--- MAGETWO-56813 -->

*  Wishlist names can now contain apostrophes. Previously, a wishlist whose name contained an apostrophe could not be edited or deleted.

#### Message framework

<!--- MAGETWO-91717 -->

*  Module names can now contain numbers. Previously, `magento/framework-message-queue/etc/queue_base.xml` contained a pattern that did not allow numbers to be used in `instanceType`, which resulted in the invalidation of custom message consumers in this file.

### General fixes

<!--- ENGCOM-3198 -->

*  The navigation arrows in fotorama now stay visible after you close the zoomed fotorama. *Fix submitted by Luuk Schakenraad in pull request [18590](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18590)*. [GitHub-18585](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18585)

[GitHub-20604](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20604)

### Gift registry

<!--- MAGETWO-95833 -->

*  The memory required to export the media gallery has been significantly reduced. [GitHub-17320](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17320)

<!--- MAGETWO-95825-->

*  We've resolved the following issues with imported images:

   *  images of all sizes reverted to the default placeholder size after import.

   *  images that were removed through the Admin before import returned after import. Magento now displays an informative error message if images are not imported as expected.

<!--- MAGETWO-91569 -->

*  Special characters in the CSV import file no longer trigger a general system exception. Previously, special characters (for example, <code>ƒ</code>, <code>ª</code>, and <code>›</code>) halted the check data phase of import.

<!--- MAGETWO-95105 -->

*  URL Key columns that contain  accented characters are now converted properly after the import of a CSV file. Previously, if you manually assigned a URL key to a product in the Admin that contained an accent character or punctuation, Magento converted it to the regular character or removed it.

[GitHub-18234](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18234)

<!--- ENGCOM-3823 -->

*  Magento now indicates correct stock status (in stock/out-of-stock) after importing products that have an indicated quantity but a status of out-of-stock from a CSV file. Previously, Magento imported the product quantity correctly, but not the stock status. *Fix submitted by p-bystritsky in pull request [20180](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20180)*. [GitHub-15950](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15950)

<!--- ENGCOM-3809 -->

*  We've resolved multiple issues that users previously encountered when importing configurable products with images and virtual products. Previously, image import failed under certain circumstances, and Magento displayed these messages:  `Imported resource (image) could not be downloaded from external resource due to timeout or access permissions in row(s)` and `Products are imported but configurable product has no image in Magento`.  *Fix submitted by Rajneesh Gupta in pull request [20127](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20127)*. [GitHub-20098](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20098)

<!--- ENGCOM-3977 -->

### Infrastructure

<!--- ENGCOM-4389  -->

[GitHub-19763](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19763)

<!--- ENGCOM-3598 -->

*  `json_encode` errors are now caught and logged in the console.log. Previously, the JSON serializer threw an error, which blocked all frontend behavior. *Fix submitted by Tommy Quissens in pull request [16154](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16154)*. [GitHub-14937](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14937)

<!--- ENGCOM-3589 -->

*  `app/bootstrap.php` has been updated to correctly define supported PHP versions. *Fix submitted by Fabrizio Balliano in pull request [19455](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19455)*. [GitHub-19453](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19453)

<!--- ENGCOM-3687 -->

<!--- ENGCOM-3364 -->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when you send an email from the command line. Previously, Magento threw an exception because `$debugHintsPath` was missing. *Fix submitted by p-bystritsky in pull request [18991](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18991)*. [GitHub-10440](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10440)

*  Message queue topic names generated as a result of asynchronous and bulk REST calls are now based on service contract names. Currently,  topic names reflect the PHP class and method names that should be invoked to handle processing. For example, a topic that was named using the older conventions (`async.V1.customers.POST`) might be named `async.magento.customer.api.accountmanagementinterface.createaccount.post`. This new naming is more semantic and allows the reuse for other Magento services.

### Integration

<!--- ENGCOM-3353 -->

*  Magento no longer throws an exception when you navigate to the OAuth page (**Backend** > **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Services** > **OAuth**). *Fix submitted by Mahesh Singh in pull request [18750](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18750)*.

[GitHub-17954](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17954)

<!--- MAGETWO-91684 -->

<!--- ENGCOM-3575 -->

*  You can now add a custom field to a newsletter in the position of your choice by editing  the newsletter configuration file (`app/code/Magento/Newsletter/etc/adminhtml/system.xml`).

[GitHub-8952](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8952)

<!--- ENGCOM-3574 -->

*  If a customer tries to subscribe to a newsletter with an email that  already has a subscription associated with it, Magento now warns the customer rather than throws an exception. *Fix submitted by Dharmesh Vaja in pull request [19416](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19416)*. [GitHub-19404](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19404)

### Payment methods

<!--- ENGCOM-3219 -->

*  Magento now populates the estimated billing address  field  on the checkout page with the default billing address as expected when the cart contains virtual products only. Previously, when a signed-in customer with different default shipping and billing addresses had a cart containing only virtual products, the cart estimation field was populated with the default shipping address information  instead of the default billing address information. *Fix submitted by Lucas Calazans in pull request [18095](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18095)*. [GitHub-17744](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17744)

<!--- ENGCOM-3393 -->

*  Invoice PDFs now include a populated FTP (Fixed Product Tax) amount field for orders when using Weee tax and FPT is enabled.

[GitHub-18617](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18617)

<!--- MAGETWO-96475 -->

*  When an order placed with PayPal fails during checkout, Magento no longer processes payment for the order. Previously, orders that failed during  checkout when being processed through PayPal were processed.

<!--- MAGETWO-96291 -->

*  A pop-up window no longer blocks completion of checkout using Braintree PayPal on a mobile device.

<!--- MAGETWO-95821 -->

<!--- MAGETWO-91526 -->

*  Orders created with eWay as a payment method now contain the same credit card information, which is included in the Authorize.Net response. Previously, the order did not contain any information regarding the credit card.

Previously, when using REST to submit an order without a payment, Magento threw an error. *Fix submitted by Vishal Gelani in pull request [18521](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/18521)*. [GitHub-15652](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/15652)

<!--- ENGCOM-3646 -->

*  Payment methods are now grouped properly in the core source model. `\Magento\Payment\Model\Config\Source\Allmethods` class in the Magento core can be used as a source model for backend configuration fields. It displays available payment methods grouped by payment provider. We've added groups for previously missing payment options (PayPal, Authorize.Net, and  Braintree methods). *Fix submitted by Wojtek Naruniec in pull request [19665](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19665)*. [GitHub-19664](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19664)

<!--- MC-4239 -->

*  The Authorize.Net payment method has been migrated to the `accept.js` API on both the storefront and Admin.

<!--- MC-5235 -->

*  PayPal Express Checkout has been updated to `checkout.js v4`. This API replaces the deprecated API Express Checkout - NVP/SOAP. This update provides Magento with a single integration but with multiple payment options that merchants can choose when activating the integration​. See [PayPal Express Checkout](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/payment/paypal-express-checkout.html)

<!--- MAGETWO-83017 -->

*  You can now place an order using Cybersource payment from the Admin.

<!--- MAGETWO-83017 -->

*  Administrators can now set additional Cybersource profile credentials (**Profile ID**, **Access key**, **Secret Key**) from the Admin and place an order from the Admin when different credentials are used on website level. Previously, Cybersource denied payments when a merchant deployed their Admin on a different domain than the store.

<!--- MAGETWO-94946 -->

*  Tax is now calculated as expected for virtual products when PayPal is used as a payment method.

### Performance

<!--- MAGETWO-95249 94346-->

*  New customer address handling improves the processing of many addresses on the Admin customer details page. This functionality was rewritten with UI components to increase platform performance, which in turn facilitates the management of customers with 3000 and more addresses. This refactoring includes these changes:

   *  All actions on the Customer Addresses tab are now performed asynchronously with AJAX. This tab now contains the default billing address and default shipping address UI component blocks, customer addresses listing or grid, and customer address form in a modal window.

   *  `\Magento\Customer\Model\Customer\DataProvider` has been replaced by `\Magento\Customer\Model\Customer\DataProviderWithDefaultAddresses` to support the asynchronous management of customer addresses.

<!--- ENGCOM-4129 -->

[GitHub-20819](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20819)

<!--- ENGCOM-3257 -->

Previously, the pager obscured page links, which prevented customers from navigating to other pages. *Fix submitted by Kajal Solanki in pull request [19298](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19298)*. [GitHub-19286](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19286)

<!--- ENGCOM-3371 -->

*  Usage of unsupported includes has been removed. Previously, when you chose a user to edit on the customers grid, Magento installations running on Internet Explorer 11.x did not load the expected page, but instead displayed this message, `object does not support method includes`.  *Fix submitted by Oleksandr Miroshnichenko in pull request [19010](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19010)*. [GitHub-18562](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18562)

### URL rewrites

<!--- MAGETWO-95539 -->

*  The storefront now properly displays the order of categories when you move categories in the Admin.

<!--- MAGETWO-91531 -->

*  Product URLs are now based on the configuration information from the Admin, not the order of records in the database. Previously, the order of records in the database affected the generated URL, and some products showed category paths for product URLS when **Use Categories Path for Product URLs** was set to **no**.

<!--- ENGCOM-3925 -->

*  The import process now retains permanent redirects for outdated product URLs as expected. Previously, the import process removed these redirects, and when you tried to open the changed product by the old URL key,  Magento displayed a 404 page. *Fix submitted by Ankur in pull request [20344](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20344)*. [GitHub-20282](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20282)

### VAT

<!--- ENGCOM-4108 -->

*  Greek VAT numbers can now be validated. *Fix submitted by Pieter Hoste in pull request [20548](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20548)*. [GitHub-6960](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/6960)

### Visual Merchandiser

<!--- MAGETWO-91602 -->

*  Visual Merchandiser now correctly sorts configurable product prices in Tile view.

### Web API

<!--- MAGETWO-70532 -->

*  The response for `GET V1/orders/:orderId` now contains `bundle_option` and `product_option` information as expected.

<!--- MAGETWO-69021 -->

*  All extension attributes listed in the documentation for `salesOrderRepositoryV1` API are now available.

<!--- ENGCOM-3834 -->

*  Access restrictions on the order API are now enforced as expected. Previously, adminstrators with restricted privileges had complete access to orders. *Fix submitted by Milind Singh in pull request [20170](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20170)*. [GitHub-20169](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20169)

### Wishlist

<!--- MAGETWO-95311 -->

*  Magento no longer retains entries for deleted products in the database `wishlist_item_option` table.

<!--- MAGETWO-91667 -->

*  You can now add a configurable product with no options  to a gift registry from a wishlist.

<!--- ENGCOM-3922 -->

*  You can now remove a comment from a wishlist product as expected. Previously, Magento did not remove the comment, even after you clicked **Update Wish List**. *Fix submitted by Khodu in pull request [20247](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20247)*. [GitHub-20245](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20245)

<!--- ENGCOM-3912 -->

*  Corrected misalignment of the Edit and remove item links on the wish list page when displayed  on a screen with a resolution of 640 x 767. *Fix submitted by Nainesh Waghale in pull request [20400](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20400)*. [GitHub-20399](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20399)

<!--- ENGCOM-3569 -->

*  Pagination controls on the wishlist page have been restored. *Fix submitted by Ratnesh Kumar in pull request [19305](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/19305)*. [GitHub-19292](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19292)

## Known issues

**Issue**:  Cart Price rules that were created with undefined end dates (that is, with the **To** field left empty) are not displayed as expected on the Staging dashboard after after upgrading from Magento Open Source to Magento Commerce 2.3.1. <!--- MC-15317-->

**Issue**: The Web Setup Wizard is not available from the Admin under these conditions:

*  base URLs are set to HTTP.

*  **Use Secure URLs in Admin** is set to **on**.

*  HTTPS is disabled.

**Workaround**: You must enable HSTS from **Stores** > **General** > **Web** > **BaseUrls (Secure)**. <!--- MC-15003-->

**Issue**: For Inventory Management, asynchronous migration of data between sources will encounter issues due to changes in Asynchronous APIs with topic names reflecting PHP class and method names. **Workaround**: We recommend using synchronous operations, setting **Run asynchronously** to "No". To configure, see [Configure Global Options](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/catalog/inventory-options-global.html) in the Magento User Guide.

**Issue**:  The CGI URL gateway in the UPS module has been updated from HTTP to HTTPS. Consequently, the UPS shipping method does not populate correctly. **Workaround**: Confirm that the Gateway URL uses the HTTPS protocol in the [UPS Shipping Method Configuration](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/configuration/sales/shipping-methods.html). <!--- MAGETWO-98947-->

*Updating an existing setting*:
If UPS Type is set to `United Parcel Service` in the UPS Shipping Method Configuration, you must manually change the protocol of the Gateway URL from HTTP to HTTPS. Example: `https://www.ups.com/using/services/rave/qcostcgi.cgi`

*To configure UPS for the first time*:

1. Navigate to **Stores**  > **Settings**  > **Configuration**  >  **Sales**  > **Shipping Methods**. Then, expand the **UPS** section.

1. At the **UPS Type** field, clear the Use system value checkbox. Then, change **UPS Type** to `United Parcel Service XML`. The Gateway URL populates correctly when this value is selected.

1. Tap **Save Config**.

*  **Issue**: The Async/Bulk Web APIs support only the default store view. A hot fix for this issue will be available in the near future. This issue has been resolved with the Scope parameter for Async/Bulk API patch, which is now available. See [Patch for Magento Framework Message Queue and Store Scopes](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Patch-for-Magento-Framework-Message-Queue-and-Store-Scopes/ba-p/135209) for a full discussion of this scope-related issue and patch contents.
