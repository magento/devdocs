### Security highlights

**Session IDs have been removed from the database**. This code change may result in breaking changes if merchants have customizations or installed extensions that use the raw session IDs stored in the database. <!--- MC-40976-->

**Restricted admin access to Media Gallery folders**. Default Media Gallery permissions now allow only directory operations (view, upload, delete, and create) that are explicitly allowed by configuration. Admin users can no longer access media assets through the Media Gallery that were uploaded outside of the `catalog/category` or `wysiwyg` directories. Administrators who want to access media assets must move them to an explicitly allowed folder or adjust their configuration settings. See [Modify Media Library folder permissions]({{page.baseurl}}/ext-best-practices/tutorials/modify-image-library-permissions/). <!--- B2B-1897-->

**Lowered limits to GraphQL query complexity**. The GraphQL maximum allowed query complexity has been lowered to prevent Denial-of-Service (DOS) attacks. See [GraphQL security configuration]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/security-configuration.html). <!--- PWA-1700-->

**Recent penetration test vulnerabilities** have been fixed in this release. <!--- MC-42431-->

The unsupported source expression `unsafe-inline` has been removed from the Content Security Policy `frame-ancestors` directive. [GitHub-33101](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/33101)<!--- MC-42632-->

## Known issue

**Issue**: Adobe Stock images uploaded into the `<install_dir>/pub/media` and `<install_dir>/pub/media/catalog` directories are not visible in the Media Gallery. **Workaround**: To view and work with these images, delete them from the filesystem directories and re-upload them into an allowed Media Gallery directory. See the [Stock images not displayed, Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source 2.3.7-p2](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409491698189) Knowledge Base article.
