## Getting started with Magento {#highlights}

Welcome to Magento 2.0 documentation! And welcome to Magento 2.0!

Here we explain the Magento platform and components from the perspective of several audiences: merchants, web store developers (frontend developers), [extension](https://glossary.magento.com/extension) developers, system administrators, installers, and integrators.

Magento is a highly-customizable eCommerce platform and content management system that is primarily used to build online storefronts or websites for selling merchandise.

Magento is written using the [PHP](https://glossary.magento.com/php) programming language, and leverages elements of the Zend framework and the model-view-controller architecture. Magento runs on the MySQL relational database, and Magento schema and tables are included in the Magento installation package.
