Integration tests require the Magento runtime environment, so they need a little preparation before they can be executed.
After preparing the system, you can execute tests using the command line interface or within an IDE like PhpStorm.

## Set up the integration test framework

To run integration tests, you must create and configure a test database.
You may also want to adjust the PHPUnit configuration, depending on your requirements.

See [Preparing Integration Test Execution][setup].

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

This option can be used for running tests locally during development or on remote servers during continuous integration.

See [Running Integration Tests in the CLI][cli run].

## PhpStorm IDE

Running integration tests inside an IDE, like PhpStorm, is convenient during development. This is mostly used when writing a new integration test.

Other than convenience, there is no benefit over running the tests on the console.

See [Running Integration Tests in PhpStorm][phpstorm run].

## Prepare integration test execution {#setup}

Before you can use the Magento integration test framework, you must prepare the test environment.
Prerequisites for the test environment include the following:

-  A dedicated integration test database
-  The test framework database configuration
-  The PHPUnit configuration matches the purpose of the integration test execution

## Integration test database

By default, for every integration test run, the test framework installs a fresh Magento test database.

{:.bs-callout-warning}
Do not use the same database as the real Magento instance. Any data, such as products, customers, orders, and everything else, will be lost!

For safety reasons, it is recommended to use a dedicated database user for running the tests. That database user should not have access to any other databases.
Here are examples of SQL commands that create a test database and a dedicated test user account:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE magento_integration_tests;
GRANT ALL ON magento_integration_tests.* TO 'magento2_test_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ftYx4pm6^x9.&^hB';
```

Replace the example database, username, and password with something that matches your requirements and conventions.

### Configure the framework for test environment

The Magento 2 integration test framework comes with a configuration file template
`mage2ce/dev/tests/integration/etc/install-config-mysql.php.dist`.

Copy this file to
`mage2ce/dev/tests/integration/etc/install-config-mysql.php`
(without the `.dist` suffix) and add your test database access credentials.

The contents will look similar to the following. Each array key will be passed as an option argument when the test
framework executes the `setup:install` command. Use the database access credentials for your test database instead of the
example values below.

```php
<?php

return [
    'db-host' => 'localhost',
    'db-user' => 'magento2_test_user',
    'db-password' => 'ftYx4pm6^x9.&^hB',
    'db-name' => 'magento_integration_tests',
    'db-prefix' => '',
    'backend-frontname' => 'backend',
    'admin-user' => \Magento\TestFramework\Bootstrap::ADMIN_NAME,
    'admin-password' => \Magento\TestFramework\Bootstrap::ADMIN_PASSWORD,
    'admin-email' => \Magento\TestFramework\Bootstrap::ADMIN_EMAIL,
    'admin-firstname' => \Magento\TestFramework\Bootstrap::ADMIN_FIRSTNAME,
    'admin-lastname' => \Magento\TestFramework\Bootstrap::ADMIN_LASTNAME,
    'amqp-host' => 'localhost',
    'amqp-port' => '5672',
    'amqp-user' => 'guest',
    'amqp-password' => 'guest',
];
```

{:.bs-callout-info}
Leave all the settings that do not start with `db-` and `amqp-` at their default values.

You can include additional setup options—available to the `setup:install` command—in the test configuration file. A
complete list of options is available [here]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-install.html#instgde-install-cli-magento).

## Adjust the PHPUnit configuration file

See the `dev/tests/integration/phpunit.xml.dist` file for the default integration test configuration.

Without adjustments, the default configuration runs all core integration tests, which is useful on a continuous integration server.

When making adjustments to the configuration, copy the default file to `dev/tests/integration/phpunit.xml` (again, without the `.dist` suffix) and make your changes there. That way, your changes will not be overwritten during Magento upgrades.

There are many settings in the file.
This guide will only describe three common adjustments.
See [PHPUnit documentation] and comments in the default file for more information about the available configuration settings.

### TESTS_CLEANUP constant

Default value:

```xml
<const name="TESTS_CLEANUP" value="enabled"/>
```

If this constant is set to `enabled`, the integration test framework cleans the test database and reinstalls Magento on every test run.
This way, any new modules will be automatically picked up and any artifacts left behind by previous test runs will be removed.
It also causes the test framework to flush the test Magento configuration, the [cache](https://glossary.magento.com/cache), and the code generation before executing any tests.

The downside of setting `TEST_CLEANUP` to `enabled` is that the reinstallation of Magento takes time; the exact time depends on the host you are using to run the integration tests and the Magento version.

During the development of new integration tests, where only a subset of the tests is executed repeatedly, that overhead of setting up a fresh execution environment for each run quickly becomes a burden.

In that case, the `TEST_CLEANUP` constant can be set to `disabled`.
The test execution will start much quicker, but as a consequence the developer must manually flush the cache and the database when needed.

The integration test framework creates the temporary test files beneath the directory
`dev/tests/integration/tmp/sandbox-*` (followed by a long hash ID).

To force the test framework to regenerate the cache and the other files, remove the directory:

```bash
rm -r dev/tests/integration/tmp/sandbox-*
```

### RABBITMQ_MANAGEMENT_PORT constant

Default value:

```xml
<const name="RABBITMQ_MANAGEMENT_PORT" value="15672"/>
```

The [RabbitMQ Management Plugin][] APIs are accessible on port `15672` by default.
This constant provides the configuration value when the test environment is not using the default.
Tests depending on `Magento\TestFramework\Helper\Amqp`, often used for validating queue and exchange status, depend on the management plugin being enabled.
Beginning in 2.3.1, the helper no longer assumes RabbitMQ is running on `localhost` and will use the connection configuration defined in `env.php`.

### PHP memory_limit

The default `phpunit.xml.dist` file does not contain any PHP `memory_limit` settings.
However, sometimes the [PHP](https://glossary.magento.com/php) configuration restricts the amount of memory PHP may consume.
This can make it impossible to run the integration tests.

You can turn off the PHP memory limit by adding the following configuration to the `<php>` section of the integration test `phpunit.xml` file:

```xml
<ini name="memory_limit" value="-1"/>
```

## Execute third party integration tests

Magento code integration tests reside in the `dev/tests/integration/testsuite` directory.
For core tests, it makes sense that the integration tests do not reside within individual modules, because most integration tests execute code from many different modules.

Specific integration tests for shop implementation could also be placed within a different subdirectory of `dev/tests/integration/testsuite`, and then would be executed together with the core tests.

However, third-party Magento extensions are contained within a single directory and might supply custom integration tests too.
These tests usually reside in the `Test/Integration/` subdirectory within the [module](https://glossary.magento.com/module) folder.

These third-party integration tests are not picked up by the default integration test configuration.
You can add a test suite configuration, like the following, to the `<testsuites>` section of the `phpunit.xml` file so they are included during test execution.

```xml
<testsuite name="Third Party Integration Tests">
    <directory>../../../app/code/*/*/Test/Integration</directory>
    <directory>../../../vendor/*/module-*/Test/Integration</directory>
    <exclude>../../../app/code/Magento</exclude>
    <exclude>../../../vendor/magento</exclude>
</testsuite>
```

Such a test suite configuration can then be executed using the `--testsuite <name>` command option. For example, if you are in the `dev/tests/integration` directory:

```bash
php ../../../vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite "Third Party Integration Tests"
```

## Run integration tests in the CLI {#cli-run}

The most common way to execute integration tests is using the command line interface (CLI).

Ensure you have [prepared the integration test environment][setup] before starting.

Integration tests must be executed from the `dev/tests/integration` working directory.
The test configuration resides in that directory and will be picked up by `phpunit` automatically, without the need to specify it as a command line option.

### Run all integration tests

By default, if no additional arguments are specified, the test configuration executes all integration tests in the `dev/tests/integration/testsuite` directory.

```bash
cd dev/tests/integration
```

```bash
../../../vendor/bin/phpunit
```

> Expected log

```terminal
PHPUnit 4.1.0 by Sebastian Bergmann.

Configuration read from /var/www/magento2/dev/tests/integration/phpunit.xml

..........................
```

The path to the `phpunit` executable installed by [Composer](https://glossary.magento.com/composer) into the vendor directory is used.

### Run only a custom testsuite

PHPUnit offers several ways to only execute a subset of tests.
For example, it is common to only execute a single test suite from the `phpunit.xml` configuration.

```bash
cd dev/tests/integration
```

```bash
../../../vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite "Memory Usage Tests"
```

### Run tests from a specific directory tree

To execute only the tests within a specific directory (for example an extension), pass the path to that directory as an argument to `phpunit`:

```bash
cd dev/tests/integration
```

```bash
../../../vendor/bin/phpunit ../../../app/code/Acme/Example/Test/Integration
```

### Run a single test class

When developing a new integration test class, it is common to run only that single test many times.
Pass the path to the file containing the test class as an argument to `phpunit`:

```bash
cd dev/tests/integration
```

```bash
../../../vendor/bin/phpunit ../../../app/code/Acme/Example/Test/Integration/ExampleTest.php
```

### Run a single test within a test class

You can run only a single test within a test class by specifying the test class together with the `--filter` argument and the name to select the test that you are currently developing:

```bash
cd dev/tests/integration
```

```bash
../../../vendor/bin/phpunit --filter 'testOnlyThisOneIsExecuted' ../../../app/code/Acme/Example/Test/Integration/ExampleTest.php
```

## Common mistakes

### Could not read files specified as arguments

This happens if the integration tests are executed from the wrong directory.

### Could not read "dev/tests/integration/phpunit.xml"

This error happens if the integration tests are executed from a different directory than `dev/tests/integration`.
To fix the issue, change to the `dev/tests/integration` directory, adjust any relative paths accordingly, and run the tests again.

### Unable to connect to MySQL

The [PHP](https://glossary.magento.com/php) interpreter must be able to connect to the test database. By default, this means the tests have to run on the same host as the MySQL server.
This problem most commonly occurs during development with Vagrant or Docker, where the Magento database is running on a virtual machine.
If the tests then are executed using a PHP interpreter on the host system, the database might not be accessible.

The error usually looks something like this:

```bash
phpunit
```

> Expected log

```bash
exception 'PDOException' with message 'SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory' in /var/www/magento2/vendor/magento/zendframework1/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php:129
```

There are many ways this problem can be resolved, but the easiest is to run the tests in the virtual machine as well.

## Run integration tests in PhpStorm {#phpstorm-run}

When writing new integration tests or during debugging, it is convenient to execute tests from within the PhpStorm IDE.

Ensure you have [prepared the integration test environment][setup] before starting.

### Create an integration test run configuration

Setting up a run configuration for integration tests is very similar to creating a run configuration for unit tests.

See [Running Unit Tests in PhpStorm][phpstorm run] for instructions on creating a basic run configuration.
Then, configure the integration test to use the configuration file.

### Use the integration test configuration file

The only difference in the run configuration is that the integration test `phpunit.xml.dist` or `phpunit.xml` configuration file from the `dev/tests/integration` directory must be selected.

## Integration tests file structure

The root folder for the Magento integration tests suite —`<magento_root>/dev/tests/integration`—contains the following sub-folders and files:

This folder contains the following sub-folders and files:

-  `framework/` – Integration testing framework scripts, configuration files and classes.
-  `Magento/` – A set of classes that implement the Magento integration tests framework.
-  `bootstrap.php` – The PHPUnit bootstrap script.
-  `etc/install-config-<db_vendor>.php` – A configuration file that provides values for installing the Magento application.
-  `testsuite/` – The test suite.
-  `tmp/` – A writable directory for storing temporary data during test execution.
-  `sandbox-<hash>/` – The folder where each Magento instance stores temporary and configuration data.
-  `phpunit.xml.dist` – A PHPUnit configuration file.
