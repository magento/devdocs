This topic discusses the ways you can:

*  Upgrade the Magento software from one version to another
*  Update any of the following:

   *  Modules (also referred to as *extensions*; extend Magento capabilities)
   *  Themes (change the look and feel of your storefront and Admin)
   *  Language packages (localize the storefront and Admin)

*  Uninstall extensions

## Upgrade the Magento application

The way you upgrade (that is, patch) the Magento application depends on how you installed it:

*  {{ce}} and {{ee}}: If you used [Composer] to install the Magento application.
*  {{ce}} only: If you cloned the Magento 2 GitHub repository because you are contributing code to the {{ce}} codebase, [upgrade the software manually].
*  If your Magento root directory is `<your Magento install directory/pub>`, you can upgrade in any of the following ways:
   *  For the upgrade, create another subdomain or docroot that uses the Magento installation directory as its root.
   *  Upgrade the Magento software using the [command line].

*  To upgrade from {{ce}} to {{ee}}, see [Upgrade from Open Source to Commerce].

 {:.bs-callout-info}
__System upgrade__ refers to updating the Magento 2.x core modules and other installed modules.
To migrate from Magento 1.x to Magento 2, see the [Migration Guide].

{:.bs-callout-warning}
For upgrade or update, you must use the same authentication keys you used to install the Magento software.

For example, you *cannot* use {{ce}} authentication keys to update or upgrade {{ee}} or vice versa.
You also *cannot* use another user's authentication keys or [Shared account] authentication keys.
