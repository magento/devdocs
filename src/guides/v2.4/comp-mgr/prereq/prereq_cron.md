To enable us to update or upgrade your system, you must have two cron jobs. Each cron job should run every minute.

{% include config/setup-cron_about.md %}

{% include config/setup-cron_how-to.md %}

For more information about cron, including how to remove a crontab and run cron from the command line, see [Configure and run cron]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-cron.html).
