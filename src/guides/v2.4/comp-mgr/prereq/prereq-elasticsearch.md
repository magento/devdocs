Before you upgrade from Magento 2.3.x to Magento 2.4, you must check whether you are using MySQL, Elasticsearch, or a third-party extension as your catalog search engine in your Magento 2.3.x instance. The result determines what you must do **before** upgrading to Magento 2.4.

You can use the CLI or the Admin to determine your catalog search engine:

*  Enter the `bin/magento config:show catalog/search/engine` command. The command returns a value of `mysql`, `elasticsearch` (which indicates Elasticsearch 2 is configured), `elasticsearch5`, `elasticsearch6`, `elasticsearch7`, or a custom value, indicating you have installed a third-party search engine.

*  From the Admin, check the value of the **Stores** > Settings > **Configuration** > **Catalog** > **Catalog** > **Catalog Search** > **Search Engine** field.

The following sections describe what actions you must take before upgrading to Magento 2.4.

## MySQL

Magento 2.4 does not support MySQL as a catalog search engine. You must install and configure Elasticsearch 7.x or 6.x before upgrading. Use the following resources to help guide you through this process:

*  [Install and configure Elasticsearch]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/v2.3/config-guide/elasticsearch/es-overview.html)
*  [Installing Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html)
*  Configure Elasticsearch to work with [nginx]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/v2.3/config-guide/elasticsearch/es-config-nginx.html) or [Apache]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/v2.3/config-guide/elasticsearch/es-config-apache.html)
*  [Configure Magento to use Elasticsearch]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/v2.3/config-guide/elasticsearch/configure-magento.html) and reindex

Some third-party catalog search engines run on top of Magento's search engine. Contact your vendor to determine whether you need to update your extension.

## Elasticsearch 2

Magento does not support Elasticsearch 2. You must update to a more recent version. Elasticsearch 7 is recommended.

Refer to [Upgrading Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html) for full instructions on backing up your data, detecting potential migration issues, and testing upgrades before deploying to production. Depending on your current version of Elasticsearch, a full cluster restart may or may not be required.

{:.bs-callout-info}
Elasticsearch requires JDK 1.8 or higher. See [Install the Java Software Development Kit (JDK)]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/prereq/elasticsearch.html#prereq-java) to check which version of JDK is installed.

[Configure Magento to use Elasticsearch]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/v2.3/config-guide/elasticsearch/configure-magento.html) describes the tasks you must perform after updating Elasticsearch 2 to a supported version.

## Elasticsearch 5

Elasticsearch 5 has reached its [End of Life](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol), and Magento support for Elasticsearch 5 has been deprecated.

Although you can upgrade to Magento 2.4 without updating Elasticsearch 5, Magento recommends that you update to Elasticsearch 7.

Refer to [Upgrading Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html) for full instructions on backing up your data, detecting potential migration issues, and testing upgrades before deploying to production. Depending on your current version of Elasticsearch, a full cluster restart may or may not be required.

[Configure Magento to use Elasticsearch]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/v2.3/config-guide/elasticsearch/configure-magento.html) describes the tasks you must perform after updating Elasticsearch 5.

## Elasticsearch 6 or 7

If you are using Elasticsearch 6 or 7 as your catalog search engine, you are not required to perform any additional steps before upgrading to Magento 2.4.

## Third-party extensions

Magento recommends that you contact your search engine vendor to determine whether your extension is fully compatible with Magento 2.4.
