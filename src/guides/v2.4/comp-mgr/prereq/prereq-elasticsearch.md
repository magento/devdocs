Before you upgrade from Magento 2.3.x to Magento 2.4, you must check whether you are using MySQL, Elasticsearch, or a third-party extension as your catalog search engine in your Magento 2.3.x instance. The result determines what you must do **before** upgrading to Magento 2.4.

You can use the CLI or the Admin to determine your catalog search engine:

-  Enter the `bin/magento config:show catalog/search/engine` command. The command returns a value of `mysql`, `elasticsearch` (which indicates Elasticsearch 2 is configured), `elasticsearch5`, `elasticsearch6`, `elasticsearch7`, or a custom value, indicating you have installed a third-party search engine.

-  From the Admin, check the value of the **Stores** > Settings > **Configuration** > **Catalog** > **Catalog** > **Catalog Search** > **Search Engine** field.

The following sections describe what actions you must take before upgrading to Magento 2.4.0.

## MySQL

Magento 2.4 no longer uses MySQL as a catalog search engine. You must install and configure Elasticsearch before upgrading. Use the following resources to help guide you through this process:

-  [Install and configure Elasticsearch]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/elasticsearch/es-overview.html)
-  [Installing Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html)
-  Configure Elasticsearch to work with [nginx]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/elasticsearch/es-config-nginx.html) or [Apache]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/elasticsearch/es-config-apache.html)
-  [Configure Magento to use Elasticsearch]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/elasticsearch/configure-magento.html) and reindex

Some third-party catalog search engines run on top of Magento's search engine. Contact your vendor to determine whether you need to update your extension.

## Elasticsearch

You must install and configure Elasticsearch before upgrading to Magento 2.4.0. Magento does not support Elasticsearch 2.x, 5.x, and 6.x.

Refer to [Upgrading Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html) for full instructions on backing up your data, detecting potential migration issues, and testing upgrades before deploying to production. Depending on your current version of Elasticsearch, a full cluster restart may or may not be required.

{:.bs-callout-info}
Elasticsearch requires JDK 1.8 or higher. See [Install the Java Software Development Kit (JDK)]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/prereq/elasticsearch.html#prereq-java) to check which version of JDK is installed.

[Configure Magento to use Elasticsearch]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/elasticsearch/configure-magento.html) describes the tasks you must perform after updating Elasticsearch 2 to a supported version.

## Third-party extensions

Magento recommends that you contact your search engine vendor to determine whether your extension is fully compatible with Magento 2.4.
