The [REST API documentation][] describes the REST APIs that are available on the latest release of Magento 2.

This documentation uses [ReDoc][] to organize and present schema files that follow an [Open-API specification][].
The schema files this tool uses are generated from a running instance of Magento {{page.guide_version}}, and
it represents the state of the code at the time the file was generated.

You can also create a dynamic REST API documentation set on your server with live data.
Magento uses [Swagger][] to display REST APIs for all installed products and allows you to try out the APIs.
For more information, see [Generate local REST API reference](generate-local.html).
