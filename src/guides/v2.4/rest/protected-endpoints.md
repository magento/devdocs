If CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA is enabled on pages requiring shopper input, then in most cases, the corresponding endpoints that send requests to the Magento server must include an HTTP header that contains a value entered by the shopper (for CAPTCHA) or generated by the Google API (for reCAPTCHA). However, if you specify an integration authorization token in the header of the endpoint, then you do not supply a header specific to CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA.

## CAPTCHA

The following table lists the forms that can be configured to require CAPTCHA. Go to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Customers** > **Customer Configuration** > **CAPTCHA** > **Forms** to enable or disable CAPTCHA on these forms.

The endpoint that corresponds to a CAPTCHA-enabled form must include the HTTP `X-Captcha` header, along with the text the shopper entered in response to the CAPTCHA challenge.
