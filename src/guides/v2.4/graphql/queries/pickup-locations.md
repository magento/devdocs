Use the `pickupLocations` query to retrieve a list of available pickup locations.

The `pickupLocations` query supports the following types of filters.

*  Area filters allow you to specify a location and a radius to find all locations within that radius.
*  Attribute filters allow you to return locations within a specified country, postal code, region, city, street, street, name, and pickup location code.

You can specify multiple filters in a query.

{:.bs-callout-info}
The `pickupLocations` query does not support searching by SKU assignment intersections.

The query supports pagination and sorting (including sorting by distance if area filtering was applied).

The query returns a `PickupLocations` object, which contains information about pagination and list of `PickupLocation` items.

## Syntax

```graphql
pickupLocations (area: AreaInput filters: PickupLocationFilterInput sort: PickupLocationSortInput pageSize: Int currentPage: Int): PickupLocations
```

## Example usage

The following query returns the closest pickup location to `Austin` with limitation in 1500 KM.
Because `pageSize` is set to 1 and distance by `distance` is applied, result will return the closest pickup location.

**Request:**

```graphql
{
  pickupLocations(
    area:{
      radius: 1500
      search_term: "Austin:US"
    }
    pageSize: 1
    currentPage: 1
    sort: {distance: ASC},
    productsInfo: [
        {
            sku: "SKU-1"
        }
    ]
  ) {
    items {
      pickup_location_code
      name
      email
      fax
      description
      latitude
      longitude
      country_id
      region_id
      region
      city
      street
      postcode
      phone
    },
    total_count
    page_info {
      page_size
      current_page
      total_pages
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

If the Pickup location is not available for the given search term, the response will be empty.
For the available Pickup location, the response would look like:
