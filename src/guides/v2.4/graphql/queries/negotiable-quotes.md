## Syntax

{
    negotiableQuotes(
        filter: NegotiableQuoteFilterInput,
        pageSize: Int = 20,
        currentPage: Int = 1
    ): NegotiableQuotesOutput
}
```

## Example usage

The following example returns general information about the negotiable quotes containing the string `request` that are accessible to the company user. The results are sorted by negotiable quote name, listed in ascending order.

**Request:**

```graphql

  negotiableQuotes(filter: { name:
    { match: "request" }
