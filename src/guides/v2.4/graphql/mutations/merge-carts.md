title: mergeCarts mutation
---

The `mergeCarts` mutation transfers the contents of a guest cart into the cart of a logged-in customer. This mutation must be run on behalf of a logged-in customer.

The mutation retains any items that were already in the logged-in customer's cart. If both the guest and customer carts contain the same item, `mergeCarts` adds the quantities. Upon success, the mutation deletes the original guest cart.

Use the [`customerCart` query]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/queries/customer-cart.html) to determine the value of the `destination_cart_id` attribute.

## Syntax

`mergeCarts(source_cart_id: String!, destination_cart_id: String!): Cart!`

## Example usage

In the following example, the customer had one Overnight Duffle in the cart (`CYmiiQRjPVc2gJUc5r7IsBmwegVIFO43`) before a guest cart (`mPKE05OOtcxErbk1Toej6gw6tcuxvT9O`) containing a Radiant Tee and another Overnight Duffle was merged. The cart now includes three items, including two Overnight Duffles.

**Request:**

```graphql
mutation {
  mergeCarts(source_cart_id: "mPKE05OOtcxErbk1Toej6gw6tcuxvT9O", destination_cart_id: "CYmiiQRjPVc2gJUc5r7IsBmwegVIFO43") {
    items {
      id
      product {
        name
        sku
      }
      quantity
    }
  }
