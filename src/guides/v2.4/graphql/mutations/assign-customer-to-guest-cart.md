The `assignCustomerToGuestCart` mutation merges a logged-in customer's shopping cart into the specified guest cart. The mutation inactivates the customer's shopping cart and moves the products to the guest cart. The guest cart is then assigned to the customer.

{:.bs-callout-info}
The `masked_id` of the guest cart contains a new value. The `quote_id` remains the same.

This mutation requires a valid [customer authentication token]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/generate-customer-token.html).

{:.bs-callout-info}
Use the [mergeCarts]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/merge-carts.html) mutation to transfer the contents of a guest cart into a customer's cart.

## Syntax

```graphql
mutation {
    assignCustomerToGuestCart(
        cart_id: String!
    ) {
        Cart!
    }
}
```

## Example usage

In the following example, the customer and guest carts each contain one item. The mutation merges the customer's cart to the guest cart. As a result, the guest cart contains two items.

**Request:**

```graphql
mutation {
  assignCustomerToGuestCart(
    cart_id: "MDYKgqIdWMKr7VD1zlYwxrB7kuX8lR5s"
  ) {
    items {
      quantity
      product {
        sku
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "assignCustomerToGuestCart": {
      "items": [
        {
          "quantity": 1,
          "product": {
            "sku": "customer_item"
          }
        },
        {
          "quantity": 1,
          "product": {
            "sku": "guest_item"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
