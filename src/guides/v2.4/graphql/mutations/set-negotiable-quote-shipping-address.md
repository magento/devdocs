title: setNegotiableQuoteShippingAddress mutation
b2b_only: true
---

The `setNegotiableQuoteShippingAddress` mutation assigns the shipping address for the specified negotiable quote. You can assign an address from the company user's address book, or define a new one. The negotiable quote must be in the UPDATED state to successfully set a shipping address.

To return a list of valid shipping addresses, construct a [`company` query]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/queries/company.html) that includes the `user` input attribute.

This query requires a valid [customer authentication token]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/generate-customer-token.html).

## Syntax

```graphql
{
    setNegotiableQuoteShippingAddress(
        input: SetNegotiableQuoteShippingAddressInput!
    ): SetNegotiableQuoteShippingAddressOutput
}
```

## Example usage

The following example adds a predefined shipping address to a negotiable quote.

**Request:**

```graphql
mutation {
  setNegotiableQuoteShippingAddress(input: {
    quote_uid: "prFSdZyHOpMXeiJ32XlBzd8e1Mte9loS"
    shipping_addresses: {
      customer_address_uid: "MQ=="
    }
  }) {
    quote {
      shipping_addresses {
