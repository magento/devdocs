title: setNegotiableQuoteBillingAddress mutation
b2b_only: true
---

The `setNegotiableQuoteBillingAddress` mutation assigns the billing address for the specified negotiable quote. You can assign an address from the company user's address book, or define a new one. The negotiable quote must be in the UPDATED state to successfully set the billing address.

To return a list of valid billing addresses, construct a [`company` query]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/queries/company.html) that includes the `user` input attribute.

This query requires a valid [customer authentication token]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/generate-customer-token.html).

## Syntax

```graphql
{
    setNegotiableQuoteBillingAddress(
        input: SetNegotiableQuoteBillingAddressInput!
    ): SetNegotiableQuoteBillingAddressOutput
}
```

## Example usage

The following example adds a new billing address to a negotiable quote.

**Request:**

```graphql

  setNegotiableQuoteBillingAddress(input: {
