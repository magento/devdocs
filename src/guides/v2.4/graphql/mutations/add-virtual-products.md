{:.bs-callout-warning}
Magento recommends using the [addProductsToCart mutation]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/add-products-to-cart.html) to add any type of product to the cart.

A virtual product represents a saleable item that is not physical, such as a membership, service, warranty, or subscription. Virtual products do not need to be shipped or downloaded, nor do they require stock management.

The `addVirtualProductsToCart` mutation allows you to add multiple virtual products to the cart at the same time, but you cannot add other product types with this mutation. To add a virtual product to a cart, you must provide the cart ID, the SKU, and the quantity. You can also optionally provide customizable options.

## Syntax

`mutation: {addVirtualProductsToCart(input: AddVirtualProductsToCartInput): {AddVirtualProductsToCartOutput}}`

## Example usage

The Luma sample data does not include any virtual products. The following example requires that you create a virtual product with the `sku` value of `Membership-Gold` with a price of $49.99.

**Request:**

```text

mutation {
  addVirtualProductsToCart(
    input: {
      cart_id: "IeTUiU0oCXjm0uRqGCOuhQ2AuQatogjG",
      cart_items: [
        {
          data: {
            quantity: 1
            sku: "Membership-Gold"
          }
        }
       ]
    }
  ) {
    cart {
      items {
        product {
          name
        }
        quantity
      }
      prices {
        grand_total {
          value
          currency
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json

  "data": {
    "addVirtualProductsToCart": {
      "cart": {
        "items": [
          {
