title: createCompany mutation

---

The `createCompany` mutation creates a company at the request of either a customer or a guest. The company definition includes the first name, last name, and email address of the company administrator. The email address assigned to the account cannot already exist in the system. Therefore, a customer attempting to create a company cannot use the same email address they used to log in to the storefront.

The company administrator cannot log in or perform additional company-related tasks until a Magento administrator approves the request to create a company.

## Syntax

```graphql
mutation {
  createCompany(
    input: CompanyCreateInput!
  ) {
    CreateCompanyOutput
  }
}
```
