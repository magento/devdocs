title: closeNegotiableQuotes mutation
b2b_only: true
---

The `closeNegotiableQuotes` mutation closes an active negotiable quote. Once a quote is closed, it cannot be re-opened. Closed negotiable quotes can be viewed by the merchant and company users.

This mutation requires a valid [customer authentication token]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/generate-customer-token.html).

## Syntax

```graphql
    closeNegotiableQuotes(
        input: CloseNegotiableQuotesInput!
    ): CloseNegotiableQuotesOutput
```

## Example usage

The following example contains an invalid `quote_uids` value, causing a FAILURE status.

**Request:**

```graphql
mutation {
  closeNegotiableQuotes(
    input: {
      quote_uids: ["xyz"]
    }
  ) {
    result_status,
    operation_results {
      ...on NegotiableQuoteUidOperationSuccess{
        __typename
        quote_uid
      }
      ...on CloseNegotiableQuoteOperationFailure{
        __typename
        quote_uid
        errors {
          __typename
          ...on ErrorInterface{
            message
          }
          ...on NoSuchEntityUidError{
            uid
          }
          ...on NegotiableQuoteInvalidStateError {
            message
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
