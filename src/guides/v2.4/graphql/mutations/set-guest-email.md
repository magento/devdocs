For guest customers, you must assign an email to the cart before you place the order.

A logged-in customer specifies an email address when they create an account. Therefore, you can place the order without explicitly setting the email.

## Syntax

`mutation: {setGuestEmailOnCart(input: SetGuestEmailOnCartInput): {SetGuestEmailOnCartOutput}}`

## Example usage

**Request:**

```graphql
mutation {
  setGuestEmailOnCart(
    input: {
      cart_id: "4JQaNVJokOpFxrykGVvYrjhiNv9qt31C"
      email: "jdoe@example.com"
    }
  ) {
    cart {
      email
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "setGuestEmailOnCart": {
      "cart": {
        "email": "jdoe@example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
