title: reorderItems mutation
---

The `reorderItems` mutation allows a logged-in user to add all the products from a previous order into their cart. The **Stores** > Settings > **Sales** > **Sales** > **Reorder** > **Allow Reorder** field must be set to **Yes** to enable reorders. You must provide a customer authorization token with the call.

The mutation returns an error if it cannot add a product to the customer's cart:

Error code | Description
--- | ---
INSUFFICIENT_STOCK | The requested quantity is greater than the available stock.
NOT_SALABLE | The product is out of stock, disabled, or otherwise prevented from being sold.
REORDER_NOT_AVAILABLE | Reorders have been disabled.
PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND | The product has been deleted.
UNDEFINED | An unknown error occurred.

The `reorderItems` mutation will not add any products to the cart if it encounters the REORDER_NOT_AVAILABLE error. For any other error code, the mutation will add the product to the cart, if possible, and it will continue adding other products, if applicable.

## Syntax

`mutation: {reorderItems(orderNumber: String!) {ReorderItemsOutput}}`

## Example usage

In the following example, the customer previously created an order containing the following items:

Item Name | SKU | Quantity Ordered
--- | --- | ---
Aeon Capri | WP07-29-Black | 3
Dual Handle Cardio Ball | 24-UG07 | 1
Elisa EverCool Tee | WS06-S-Gray | 1
Sprite Foam Yoga Brick | 24-WG084 | 1

The customer wants to reorder these items, but the status of some of these items has changed:

-  Aeon Capri (WP07-29-Black) is in stock, but fewer than three items are available for sale.
-  The Sprite Foam Yoga Brick (24-WG084) is out of stock.

These items will not be added to the cart.

**Request:**

```graphql
mutation{
  reorderItems(orderNumber: "000000003"){
    cart {
      id
      items {
        uid
