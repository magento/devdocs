title: requestNegotiableQuote mutation
b2b_only: true
---

The `requestNegotiableQuote` mutation initiates a negotiable quote on behalf of a company user. The company user must add all products to the cart before requesting a negotiable quote. Once the request is submitted, company users cannot add new products to the quote.

If the request is successful, Magento assigns the cart ID to the negotiable quote. Therefore, the same cart ID is used throughout the lifecycle of the negotiable quote. Magento generates a new cart ID if the company user starts a new order while a negotiable quote is in process. The cart ID must be active. You cannot create a negotiable quote if the quote is cancelled or converted to an order.

If the request is successful, the negotiable quote has the SUBMITTED status.

{:.bs-callout-info}
If the negotiable quote requires a shipping address (for negotiation or tax calculations), you can use the [`setNegotiableQuoteShippingAddresses` mutation]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/set-negotiable-quote-shipping-address.html) to add the address to the standard quote during the negotiable quote process.

This mutation requires a valid [customer authentication token]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/generate-customer-token.html).

## Syntax

```graphql
requestNegotiableQuote(
    input: RequestNegotiableQuoteInput!
): RequestNegotiableQuoteOutput
```

## Example usage

The following example requests a negotiable quote. The cart contains three items.

**Request:**

        subtotal_including_tax {
          value
        }
        subtotal_with_discount_excluding_tax {
          value
        }
        grand_total {
          value
        }
