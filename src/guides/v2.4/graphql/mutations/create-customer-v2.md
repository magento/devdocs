title: createCustomerV2 mutation
---

The `createCustomerV2` mutation creates a customer account. Use the [`createCustomerAddress` mutation]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/create-customer-address.html) to complete the customer profile and define billing and shipping addresses.

The `createCustomerV2` mutation supersedes the `createCustomer` mutation as the means to create a customer account. The input objects differ between these two mutations. The `createCustomer` mutation required the `CustomerInput` object, as did the `updateCustomer` mutation. The attributes required for creating a customer are different than those for updating a customer, but you could not determine this by looking at the schema. The `createCustomerV2` mutation requires the `CustomerCreateInput` object, which it does not share with the [`updateCustomerV2` mutation]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/update-customer-v2.html).

## Syntax

`mutation: {createCustomerV2(input: CustomerCreateInput!) {CustomerOutput}}`

## Example usage

The following call creates a new customer.

**Request:**

```graphql
mutation {
  createCustomerV2(
    input: {
      firstname: "Bob"
      lastname: "Loblaw"
      email: "bobloblaw@example.com"
      password: "b0bl0bl@w"
      is_subscribed: true
    }
  ) {
    customer {
      firstname
      lastname
      email
      is_subscribed
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createCustomer": {
      "customer": {
        "firstname": "Bob",
        "lastname": "Loblaw",
        "email": "bobloblaw@example.com",
        "is_subscribed": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
