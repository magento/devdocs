title: placeNegotiableQuoteOrder mutation
b2b_only: true
---

The `placeNegotiableQuoteOrder` mutation converts a negotiable quote into an order and returns an order ID.

The negotiable quote must have one of the following statuses:

-  SUBMITTED
-  DECLINED
-  EXPIRED

If the status is DECLINED or EXPIRED, the negotiable quote is processed like a standard cart, without applying any discounts. The negotiable quote is not converted to a standard cart.

Perform the following actions before using the `placeNegotiableQuoteOrder` mutation. It might be necessary to perform additional steps during the process of coming to an agreement during the negotiable quote lifecycle.

-  [Create an empty cart]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/create-empty-cart.html)
-  [Add one or more products]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/add-products-to-cart.html) to the cart
-  [Request a negotiable quote]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/request-negotiable-quote.html)
-  [Set the billing address]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/set-negotiable-quote-billing-address.html)
-  [Set the shipping address]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/set-negotiable-quote-shipping-address.html)
-  Set the shipping method
-  [Set the payment method]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/set-negotiable-quote-payment-method.html)

You cannot manage orders with GraphQL, because orders are part of the backend. You can use REST or SOAP calls to manage orders to their completion.
