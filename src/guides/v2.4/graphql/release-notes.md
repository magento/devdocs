*Release notes published October 2020.*

GraphQL is a flexible and performant API that allows you to build custom front-ends, including headless storefronts, [Progressive Web Apps](https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio) (PWA), and mobile apps for Magento.

To take part and contribute, see the [Magento 2](https://github.com/magento/magento2) repository and look for issues with the `Project: GraphQL` tag. Join us in our [Slack](https://magentocommeng.slack.com/messages/C8076E0KS) channel (or [self signup](https://tinyurl.com/engcom-slack)) to discuss the project.

These release notes can include:

-  {:.new}New features
-  {:.fix}Fixes and improvements

## {{site.data.var.ee}} and {{site.data.var.ce}} 2.4.1

As of version 2.4.1, the [Magento Open Source 2.4.1 Release Notes]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/open-source-2-4-1.html) and [Magento Commerce 2.4.1 Release Notes]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/commerce-2-4-1.html) describe the new GraphQL features and bug fixes.

## {{site.data.var.ee}} and {{site.data.var.ce}} 2.4.0

-  {:.new} **Added the [`reorderItems` mutation]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/reorder-items.html).** This mutation enables the logged-in customer to add the contents of a previous order to their cart.

-  {:.new} **Added the [`categories` query]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/queries/categories.html) returns a list of categories that match a specified filter.** This query differs from the `categoryList` query in that it supports pagination.

-  {:.new} **Added the [`pickupLocations` query]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/queries/pickup-locations.html).** When the Inventory in-store pickup feature is enabled, this query allows the shopper to select a pickup location. The `pickup_location_code` attribute has been added to the [`setShippingAddressesOnCart` mutation]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/set-shipping-address.html) to specify which source will serve as the pickup location.

The [Magento Open Source 2.4.0 Release Notes]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/release-notes-2-4-0-open-source.html#graphql-1) and [Magento Commerce 2.4.0 Release Notes]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/release-notes-2-4-0-commerce.html#graphql-1) list the bug fixes.

## {{site.data.var.ee}} and {{site.data.var.ce}} 2.3.5

-  {:.new} **The `products` and `categoryList` queries can now be used to retrieve information about products and categories that have been added to a staged campaign.** These queries require an admin authorization token. See [Using queries](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/graphql/queries/index.html#staging) for details.
-  {:.fix} Custom attributes used in layered navigation no longer require the **Use in Search**, **Visible in Advanced Search**, and **Use in Search Results Layered Navigation** fields be set to Yes.
-  {:.fix} Added the `position` and `disabled` attributes to the `MediaGalleryInterface`.
-  {:.fix} When you apply a gift card to a cart, an exception is no longer thrown when the last product is removed from the cart.
-  {:.fix} In a category search, the `image` attribute returns the full path to an image, rather than a truncated path.
-  {:.fix} Flat rate shipping amounts are calculated correctly when you add a configurable product to a cart.

## {{site.data.var.ee}} and {{site.data.var.ce}} 2.3.4

-  {:.new} **Guest carts can now be merged with customer carts.** The [`mergeCarts`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/merge-carts.html) mutation transfers the contents of a guest cart into the cart of a logged-in customer.
-  {:.new} **A customer can start an order on one device and complete it on another.** Use the [`customerCart`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/queries/customer-cart.html) query to obtain the cart ID for a logged-in customer.
-  {:.new} **Layered navigation can use custom filters.** The `filter` attribute of the [`products`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/queries/products.html) query now requires the `ProductAttributeFilterInput` object. You can specify a pre-defined filter in this object, or [define a custom filter]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/custom-filters.html). As a result, layered navigation on your website filters on the attributes you need.
-  {:.new} **You can search categories by ID, name, and/or URL key.** The [`categoryList`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/queries/category-list.html) query replaces the deprecated `category` query.
-  {:.new} **A customer can add bundle and downloadable products to the cart with the [`addBundleProductsToCart`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/add-bundle-products.html) and [`addDownloadableProductsToCart`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/add-downloadable-products.html) mutations.**
-  {:.new} **The [`ProductInterface`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/interfaces/product-interface.html) supports fixed product taxes (such as WEEE).** Use the [`storeConfig`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/queries/store-config.html) query to determine whether the store supports these taxes.
-  {:.new} **The [`cart`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/queries/cart.html) object has been enhanced to include information about promotions and applied discounts at the line and cart levels.**
-  {:.new} **Added test coverage in multiple GraphQL modules.**

The following queries and mutations have been deprecated:

Deprecated entity | Use this instead
--- | ---
`category` query | `categoryList` query
`setPaymentMethodOnCartAndPlaceOrder` mutation | Run the `setPaymentMethodOnCart` and `placeOrder` mutations in the same request
`wishlist` query | `customer` query

## {{site.data.var.ee}} and {{site.data.var.ce}} 2.3.3
