title: Adobe Commerce 2.4.3-p1 Release Notes
---

{{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.3-p1 is a security-only release that provides seven security fixes that enhance your {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.3 or {{ site.data.var.ce }} 2.4.3 deployment. Merchants can now install time-sensitive security fixes without applying the hundreds of functional fixes and enhancements that a full quarterly release provides. Patch 2.4.3-p1 provides fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in our previous quarterly release, {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.3 and {{ site.data.var.ce }} 2.4.3.

Quarterly releases may contain backward-incompatible changes (BIC). To review minor backward-incompatible changes, see [BIC reference]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/reference.html). (Major backward-incompatible issues are described in [BIC highlights]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/index.html). Not all releases introduce major BICs.)

## What's in this release?

Seven security fixes and several security enhancements are included in this security patch. Only one of these seven fixes is an externally reported vulnerability. Fixes for externally reported vulnerabilities are documented in the [Adobe Security Bulletin](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb21-86.html).

Security-only patches typically include all hotfixes that have been released for the preceding complete release. This release incorporates the two hot fixes that have been released for {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.3 and {{ site.data.var.ce }} 2.4.3. See [Adobe Commerce 2.4.3 Release Notes]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/commerce-2-4-3.html) for information about these hotfixes.

This release also includes bug fixes for the [Braintree](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/payment/braintree.html), [Klarna](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/payment/klarna.html#changes-in-the-latest-release), and [Vertex](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/tax/vertex.html#changes-in-the-latest-release) vendor-developed extensions.

### Resolution of known issues in Adobe Commerce 2.4.3

This release includes a fix for the PHP fatal error on upgrade known issue, which was first identified in {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.3 or {{ site.data.var.ce }} 2.4.3. This issue was previously addressed by patch `AC-384__Fix_Incompatible_PHP_Method__2.3.7-p1_ce.patch to address PHP fatal error on upgrade`.

### Security highlights

**Session IDs have been removed from the database**. This code change may result in breaking changes if merchants have customizations or installed extensions that use the raw session IDs stored in the database. <!--- MC-40976-->

**Restricted admin access to Media Gallery folders**. Default Media Gallery permissions now allow only directory operations (view, upload, delete, and create) that are explicitly allowed by configuration. Admin users can no longer access media assets through the Media Gallery that were uploaded outside of the `catalog/category` or `wysiwyg` directories. Administrators who want to access media assets must move them to an explicitly allowed folder or adjust their configuration settings. See [Modify Media Library folder permissions]({{page.baseurl}}/ext-best-practices/tutorials/modify-image-library-permissions/). <!--- B2B-1897-->

**Lowered limits to GraphQL query complexity**. The GraphQL maximum allowed query complexity has been lowered to prevent Denial-of-Service (DOS) attacks. See [GraphQL security configuration]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/security-configuration.html). <!--- PWA-1700-->

**Recent penetration test vulnerabilities** have been fixed in this release. <!--- MC-42431-->

The Content Security Policy directive `frame-ancestors` now supports the source expression `unsafe-inline`.  [GitHub-33101](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/33101) <!--- MC-42632-->
