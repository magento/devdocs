## What's in this release?

This security patch includes:

*  Resolution of the vulnerability addressed by `MDVA-43395_EE_2.4.3-p1_COMPOSER_v1.patch.zip`, `MDVA-43443_EE_2.4.3-p1_COMPOSER_v1.patch.zip`,`MDVA-43395_EE_2.4.3-p1_COMPOSER_v1.patch`, and `MDVA-43443_EE_2.4.3-p1_COMPOSER_v1.patch`
*  Security enhancements
*  Two security bug fixes. See [Adobe Security Bulletin](https://helpx.adobe.com/security.html) for the latest discussion of these fixed issues.

### Security highlights

Security improvements for this release improve compliance with the latest security best practices, including:

*  Email variable usage was deprecated back in 2.3.4 as part of a security risk mitigation in favor of a more strict variable syntax. This legacy behavior has been fully removed in this release as a continuation of that security risk mitigation.

   As a result, email or newsletter templates that worked in previous versions of Magento may not work correctly after upgrading to Adobe Commerce 2.4.3-p2. Affected templates include admin overrides, themes, child themes, and templates from custom modules or third-party extensions. Your deployment may still be affected even after using the [Upgrade compatibility tool](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/upgrade-guide/upgrade-compatibility-tool/overview.html?lang=en) to fix deprecated usages. See [Migrating custom email templates]({{page.baseurl}}/frontend-dev-guide/templates/template-email-migration.html) for information about potential effects and guidelines for migrating affected templates.

*  OAuth access tokens and password reset tokens are now encrypted when stored in the database. <!--- AC-520 1323-->

*  Validation has been strengthened to prevent the upload of non alpha-numeric file extensions. <!--- AC-479-->

*  Swagger is now disabled by default when {{ site.data.var.ee }} is in production mode. <!--- AC-1450-->

*  Developers can now configure the limit on the size of arrays accepted by {{ site.data.var.ee }} RESTful endpoints on a per-endpoint basis. See [API security](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/get-started/api-security.html). <!--- AC-465-->

*  Added mechanisms for limiting the size and number of resources that a user can request through a web API on a system-wide basis, and for overriding the defaults on individual modules. This resolves the issue addressed by `MC-43048__set_rate_limits__2.4.3.patch`. See [API security](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/get-started/api-security.html). <!--- AC-1120-->
