title: Magento Commerce 2.4.2 Release Notes
---

Magento Commerce 2.4.2 introduces enhancements to performance and security plus significant platform improvements. Security enhancements include expansion of support for the `SameSite` attribute for all cookies. B2B improvements focus on support for online payments for purchase orders. Elasticsearch 7.9.x and Redis 6.x are now supported.

This release includes over 280 new fixes to core code and 35 security enhancements. It includes the resolution of almost 290 GitHub issues by our community members. These community contributions range from minor clean-up of core code to significant enhancements in GraphQL.

All known issues identified in Magento 2.4.1 have been fixed in this release.

{:.bs-callout-info}

Quarterly releases may contain backward-incompatible changes (BIC). Magento 2.4.2 contains minor backward-incompatible changes. To review minor backward-incompatible changes, see [BIC reference]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/reference.html). (Major backward-incompatible issues are described in [BIC highlights]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/index.html). Not all releases introduce major BICs.)

## Security-only patch available

Merchants can now install time-sensitive security fixes without applying the hundreds of functional fixes and enhancements that a full quarterly release provides (for example, Magento 2.4.1-p1). Patch 2.4.0.12 (Composer package 2.4.1-p1) is a security-only patch that provides fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in our previous quarterly release, Magento 2.4.1. All hot fixes that were applied to the 2.4.1 release are included in this security-only patch. (A *hot fix* provides a fix to a released version of Magento that addresses a specific problem or bug.)

For general information about security-only patches, see the Magento DevBlog post [Introducing the New Security-only Patch Release](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Introducing-the-New-Security-only-Patch-Release/ba-p/141287). For instructions on downloading and applying security-only patches (including patch 2.4.1-p1), see [Install Magento using Composer]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/composer.html). Security-only patches include security bug fixes only, not the additional security enhancements that are included in the full patch.

## Other release information

Although code for these features is bundled with quarterly releases of the Magento core code, several of these projects (for example, B2B, Page Builder, and Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Studio) are also released independently. Bug fixes for these projects are documented in the separate, project-specific release information that is available in the documentation for each project.

## Highlights

Look for the following highlights in this release.

### Substantial security enhancements

This release includes over 35 security fixes and platform security improvements. All security fixes have been backported to Magento 2.4.1-p1 and Magento 2.3.6-p1.

#### Over 35 security enhancements that help close remote code execution (RCE) and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities

No confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. Most of these issues require that an attacker first obtains access to the Admin. As a result, we remind you to take all necessary steps to protect your Admin, including but not limited to these efforts: IP allowlisting, [two-factor authentication]({{page.baseurl}}/security/two-factor-authentication.html), use of a VPN, the use of a unique location rather than `/admin`, and good password hygiene.

#### Additional security enhancements

Security improvements for this release include:

*  All core cookies now support the `SameSite` attribute.

*  Magento now displays messages that identify potentially malicious content in product and category description fields when the user tries to save values in these fields.

*  File system operations across Magento components have been standardized and hardened to prevent malicious uploads.

*  Core Content Security Policy (CSP) violations have been fixed.

{:.bs-callout-info}
Starting with the release of Magento Commerce 2.3.2, Magento will assign and publish indexed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers with each security bug reported to us by external parties. This allows users of Magento Commerce to more easily identify unaddressed vulnerabilities in their deployment. You can learn more about CVE identifiers at [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/).

### Infrastructure improvements

This release contains enhancements to core quality, which improve the quality of the Framework and these functional areas: Customer Account, Catalog, CMS, OMS, Import/Export, Promotions and Targeting, Cart and Checkout, B2B, and Staging and Preview.

### Platform enhancements

*  [**Elasticsearch 7.9.x is now supported**]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/system-requirements.html#elasticsearch). Although we recommend running Elasticsearch 7.9.x, Magento 2.4.x remains compatible with Elasticsearch 7.4.x. <!--- MC-36867-->

*  Magento 2.4.2 has been tested with [Varnish 6.4]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/system-requirements.html#technologies-magento-can-use). Magento 2.4.x remains compatible with Varnish 6.x.

*  [**Redis 6.x is now supported**]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/system-requirements.html#technologies-magento-can-use). Magento 2.4.x remains compatible with Redis 5.x. <!--- MC-34853-->

*  Magento 2.4.2 is now compatible with **Composer 2.x**. We recommend that merchants migrate to Composer 2.x. Although you can install this release using Composer 1.x, Composer 1.x will soon reach end-of-life. For an overview of Composer 2.x features, see [Composer 2.0 is now available!](https://blog.packagist.com/composer-2-0-is-now-available/)

The ability to configure a Magento installation to use a split database has been deprecated in this release. Merchants who currently use split database should start planning to revert to or migrate to a single database or use an alternative approach. See the [Deprecation of split database functionality in Magento Commerce](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Deprecation-of-Split-Database-in-Magento-Commerce/ba-p/465187) DevBlog post for an overview of this issue.  See [Revert from a split database to a single database]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/revert-split-database.html) for migration instructions.

### Performance enhancements

This release includes code enhancements that boost API performance and Admin response time for deployments with large catalogs. Multiple scalability enhancements enable Magento 2.4.2 to natively support complex catalogs up to 20x larger than in previous releases.

### GraphQL

This release adds GraphQL coverage for the following features:

*  Added support for multiple wishlists. You can use GraphQL to [create]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/mutations/create-wishlist.html), [delete]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/mutations/delete-wishlist.html), and [rename]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/mutations/update-wishlist.html) wishlists as well as [move]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/mutations/move-products-between-wishlists.html) or [copy]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/mutations/copy-products-between-wishlists.html) items between them. <!--- MC-32356-->

*  Added support for returned merchandise authorizations (RMA). Shoppers can [request a return]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/request-return.html). If the merchant accepts the request, the shopper can perform tasks such as [adding a comment]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/add-return-comment.html) and [add tracking information]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/add-return-tracking.html). <!--- MC-34596-->

*  Added support for the following B2B features:
   *  Companies. You can add company [administrators]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/create-company.html), [users]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/create-company-user.html), [roles]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/create-company-role.html), and [teams]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/create-company-team.html). <!--- MC-33861-->
   *  Company credit. The [company query]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/queries/company.html) includes details about the company's credit history. The `ConfigurableOptionsSelectionMetadata` and `ConfigurableOptionAvailableForSelection` data types have been added to the schema to provide this functionality.<!--- MC-33862-->
   *  Requisition lists. You can [create]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/create-requisition-list.html), [delete]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/mutations/delete-requisition-list.html), and [update]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/update-requisition-list.html) requisition lists. Support also includes the ability to [add]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/add-products-to-requisition-list.html), [update]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/update-products-in-wishlist.html), [delete]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/delete-requisition-list-items.html), [copy]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/copy-items-between-requisition-lists.html), and [move]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/move-items-between-requisition-lists.html) items within a requisition list as well as add requisition list items [into the cart]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/add-requisition-list-items-to-cart.html). <!--- MC-34312-->

*  Added support for unions in Magento GraphQL. [GitHub-29425](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29425) <!-- ENGCOM-8291 -->

*  Added support for [comparison lists]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/queries/compare-list.html). Shoppers can [create]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/mutations/create-compare-list.html) and [delete]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/mutations/delete-compare-list.html) comparison lists, and [add]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/mutations/add-products-to-compare-list.html) and [remove]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/mutations/remove-products-from-compare-list.html) items to the comparison lists. In addition, shoppers that create a compare list as a guest can log in as a customer and [retain]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/mutations/assign-compare-list-to-customer.html) their comparison lists.

*  Added the [`generateCustomerTokenAsAdmin`]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/mutations/generate-customer-token-as-admin.html) mutation and updated the `Customer` object to support remote purchasing assistance.

*  Added localization support across stores to support tasks such as changing languages, carts, and currencies. <!--- MC-37801-->

*  The GraphQL schema has been enhanced to optimize product data retrieval for configurable products with many variants. <!--- MC-36138-->

*  Integer type object IDs have been deprecated in favor of `uid` attributes of type ID. <!--- MC-36346-->

*  Added the `staging` attribute to the [`ProductInterface`]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/interfaces/product-interface.html) and [`CategoryInterface`]({{ page.baseurl }}/graphql/interfaces/category-interface.html) to determine if a product is staged and to view its associated campaign information. <!--- MC-33897-->

See the [GraphQL Developer Guide]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/) for details on these enhancements.

### B2B

Magento 2.4.2 introduces B2B v1.3.1. This release includes support for online payments for purchase orders as well as multiple bug fixes.

**Purchase orders can now be completed using online payment methods**. B2B buyers are prompted to select their preferred payment method for each [purchase order](https://docs-beta.magento.com/user-guide/stores/b2b-purchase-order-flow.html) during the initial checkout. After the purchase order has been approved, buyers are prompted to enter payment details to convert the purchase order to a final order.

To support a complete workflow for accepting online payments, this feature also:

*  Overrides existing payment method templates during initial checkout to maintain PCI compliance.

*  Maintains compatibility with third-party, custom, and community-developed payment methods.

*  Notifies buyers by email when they need to add payment details to an approved purchase order.

*  Enables customization of emails from the Admin, which allows merchants to use templates that are consistent with their branding.

*  Introduces an `Approved – Pending Payment` state for purchase orders to clearly show when action is required.

*  Prevents discount codes from being added or removed at the final payment step, which ensures that the order total amount remains unchanged for approved purchase orders.

*  Allows buyers to change the payment method during the final payment step to maintain flexibility and increase conversion.

This release also includes multiple bug fixes. See [B2B Release Notes]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/b2b-release-notes.html).

### PWA Studio

This release of PWA Studio includes:

*  Internationalization and localization. Venia now provides support for multiple languages and currencies.

*  Support for multiple stores.

*  Enhanced extensibility.

*  Performance optimizations. Client-side performance has been enhanced with Google Lighthouse.

*  Introduction of My Account for Venia. This introduction of My Account features including order history (details), address book, and saved payments.

For information about enhancements and bug fixes, see [PWA Studio releases](https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio/releases). See [Magento compatibility](https://magento.github.io/pwa-studio/technologies/magento-compatibility/) for a list of PWA Studio versions and their compatible Magento core versions.

### Page Builder

This release includes enhancements to Page Builder content migration and Page Builder CSS customization:

*  Developers can now style content type output differently per viewport without using the `!important` directive.

*  Content migrated to Page Builder is no longer padded with default inline styling.

*  Page Builder no longer requires all content types to be placed within a row. The [Page Builder stage](https://docs-beta.magento.com/user-guide/cms/page-builder-workspace.html#stage) is now initially blank and supports adding the following content types directly to the stage: Rows, Columns, Tabs, HTML Code, Blocks, Dynamic Blocks.

*  Predefined margins and paddings are no longer required for content types.

*  The new mobile [viewport switcher](https://docs-beta.magento.com/user-guide/cms/page-builder-workspace.html#viewports) and viewport scope for form field values lets users and developers perform these actions:

   *  View content on different view ports when authoring.

   *  Optimize minimum height field parameter on different content types for each viewport. (Only one parameter (min height) is supported out of the box. Custom development required to enable mobile optimization for other content parameters.)

   *  Add field scope to custom fields and field sets (developers).

### Interactive In-Product Guidance

Interactive In-Product Guidance provides merchants with usage tips and information from within the Admin on new feature announcements, walk-through guides, on-boarding information, and tool tips.  **Administrators must opt-in from the Admin to receive in-product guidance if this feature is not enabled**. See [Usage Data Collection](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/admin.html) and [Admin Usage](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/advanced/admin.html#admin-usage).

### Adobe Stock Integration

This release includes Adobe Stock Integration v2.1.1.

### Media Gallery

**New Role Resources for Media Gallery**. This release provides merchants the ability to limit administrator access to only the Media gallery and to control who can perform these actions:

*  Insert media assets into content

*  Upload assets

*  Edit assets details

*  Delete assets from the Media Gallery

*  Manage folder structure.

**Web-optimized images in content**. Merchants can now use [web-optimized image rendition](https://docs-beta.magento.com/user-guide/cms/media-gallery-image-optimization.html) in content instead of high resolution images. The original image remains unmodified in the Media Gallery, and the image rendition is dynamically generated when the image is inserted in the content.

### AWS S3 support enhancements

Amazon Simple Storage Service (AWS S3) support has been enhanced to include support for:

*  Object storage and future extensibility

*  [Storing media files]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/remote-storage/config-remote-storage.html) on AWS S3

Support for AWS S3 has been added to all modules including B2B, PageBuilder, and Adobe Stock Integration.

### Magento Functional Testing Framework (MFTF)

MFTF 3.2.1 is now available. This release introduces error tolerance in both tests and test suite generation. Additional enhancements and bug fixes are described in the [Magento Functional Testing Framework Changelog](https://github.com/magento/magento2-functional-testing-framework/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md).

### Order Management System (OMS)

The MCOM Connector is fully compatible with Magento 2.4.2. Bug fixes and enhancements to the connector are described in [Release notes for Connector](https://omsdocs.magento.com/release-notes/connector/index.html). This release includes improvements to the OMS command-line interface, which now provides verbose information that partners and support teams can use to troubleshoot `retry`, `queue_prune`, `order_sync`, `message process`, and `catalog export` processes.

### Vendor Developed Extensions

See the following articles for updates on features and changes for this release:

*  [Amazon Pay](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/payment/amazon-pay.html). Amazon Pay has been deprecated in this release and will be removed in Magento 2.5.0. Magento 2.4.3 and higher will contain only updates for compatibility and fixes for major bugs.

## Fixed issues

We have fixed hundreds of issues in the Magento 2.4.2 core code.

### Installation, upgrade, deployment

<!--- MC-38429-->

*  The ability to configure a Magento installation to use a split database has been deprecated in this release. See the [Deprecation of split database functionality in Magento Commerce](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Deprecation-of-Split-Database-in-Magento-Commerce/ba-p/465187) DevBlog post.

<!--- MC-36472-->

*  Merchants can now successfully upgrade an Open Source deployment that runs MySQL 8.x to a Commerce deployment. Previously, Magento threw an exception when `AUTO_INCREMENT` values reverted to initial values for all tables where `row_id` was added during upgrade.

<!-- ENGCOM-7280 -->

*  Magento now displays an error message that identifies the path that was used to create the patch if an error occurs when running `bin/magento/setup:db:generate-patch`. [GitHub-27523](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27523)

<!-- ENGCOM-8029 -->

*  `block_html`, `full_page`, and `layout` caches are now disabled as expected after `bin/magento/setup:upgrade` execution. [GitHub-28186](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28186)

<!-- ENGCOM-8184 -->

*  The minimum required PHP version in `bootstrap.php` has been updated. [GitHub-30004](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30004)

<!--- MC-38788-->

*  You can now execute `bin/magento/setup:upgrade` after installing sample data. Previously, when you tried to execute `bin/magento/setup:upgrade`, Magento displayed this error: `unable to apply data patch magento\catalogrulesampledata\setup\patch\data\installcatalogrulesampledata for module magento_catalogrulesampledata`. Magento also displayed this error in the system log: `main.ERROR: Sample Data error: Unable to unserialize value. Error: Syntax error`. [GitHub-30685](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30685)

<!--- MC-36785-->

*  You can now set a YouTube API key from the command line as expected. Previously, Magento returned this error when you tried to execute `bin/magento config:sensitive:set catalog/product_video/youtube_api_key`: `There are no sensitive configurations to fill`.

<!-- ENGCOM-8163 -->

*  Magento now honors the `maxMessages` values that are defined in `queue_consumer.xml`. Previously, Magento used only the deployment configuration values. [GitHub-29522](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29522)

<!-- ENGCOM-8243 -->

*  URL generation for a new store now works as expected when the store is created using `bin/magento setup:config:import`. Previously, URL rewrites were not generated in production environments. [GitHub-30025](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30025)

<!-- ENGCOM-8230 -->

*  Magento no longer displays this question when you run `bin/magento setup:install` to connect to existing database: `Overwrite the existing configuration for db-ssl-verify?[Y/n]`. [GitHub-29612](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29612)

### AdminGWS

<!--- MC-37040-->

*  The **Add New Rating** button and the **Save**, **Delete**, **Reset** buttons are no longer available on the **Stores** > **Attribute** > **Rating** page for an administrator with restricted permissions.

<!--- MC-35804-->

*  The Admin now displays data only from websites that the logged-in administrator has permissions to. Previously, the Admin displayed data from all websites in the deployment.

<!--- MC-35027-->

*  All selected websites are now stored in `gws_websites` regardless of the size of the website ID. Previously, website IDs were truncated, and the list of selected websites was not stored in the database. User roles were not correctly saved, and Magento displayed this error when a merchant tried to change and save a role: `The "X" store ID is incorrect. Verify the store ID and try again`.

<!--- MC-37223-->

*  Magento now displays the correct item count in Admin grids for restricted admin users. Previously, counts displayed for these grids reflected data for all countries while the grids themselves displayed data from specific countries only. (This fix corrects an issue with  Customers Segments, Catalog Price Rules, Cart Price Rules, All Users, Locked Users and User Roles grids.)

<!--- MC-34156-->

*  Administrators whose permissions exclude `Magento_Catalog::edit_product_design` (Edit Product Design) can now create a new product by saving an existing product with a new name in the selected store view. Previously, Magento displayed this error:  `Not allowed to edit the product's design attributes`. [GitHub-28106 ](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28106)

<!--- MC-36406-->

*  Magento no longer displays the **Add Attribute** button on pages under **Stores** > Attributes when an administrator lacks the appropriate permissions to create these entities. Previously, Magento threw a 404 error when a website administrator who did not have the appropriate permissions tried to create an **Attribute Set** or **Customer** attribute.

<!-- ENGCOM-8230 -->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when you try to change `backend-frontname` using the `ssh` container after installing Magento. [GitHub-26762](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26762)

### Adobe Stock Integration

<!--- ENGCOM-8020-->

*  Added support for reading `exif_image.png` or `exif-image.jpeg` metadata. [GitHub-1449](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1449)

<!-- ENGCOM-8194 8094 8147 -->

*  The content displayed when you click the Default View bookmark for the Media Gallery is no longer filtered. Previously, the default view contained a filter that was applied from `url-filter` applier. [GitHub-1813](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1813), [GitHub-1789](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1789), [GitHub-1780](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1780)

<!-- ENGCOM-8070 -->

*  Logic has been removed from the WYSIWYG OnInsert controller (`Magento\Cms\Controller\Adminhtml\Wysiwyg\Images\OnInsert::execute()`) and added to the `Model\Wysiwyg\Images\PrepareImage::execute()` model. [GitHub-1504](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1504)

<!-- ENGCOM-8081 -->

*  Area emulation has been removed from the `media-content:sync` command (`\Magento\MediaContentSynchronization\Console\Command\Synchronize::execute`). [GitHub-1784](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1784)

### Analytics

<!--- MC-37137-->

*  Advanced Reporting now works as expected for multiple environments in the same domain. Previously, CSV files that were generated by Advanced Reporting failed because double quotes were escaped with backslashes rather than with another double quote as required by CSV standard RFC4180.

<!--- MC-35996-->

*  The `analytics_collect_data` job now runs successfully when using either the default or non-default port to connect to MySQL in `env.php`. Previously, `analytics_collect_data` threw an error when you used the non-default port.

<!--- MC-35407-->

*  CSV files that are generated by `analytics_collect_data` are now properly escaped. Previously, these files were not generated with the correct escaping, which prevented the generation of Inventory reports.

### Braintree

*  Shoppers can now use Apple Pay to successfully place an order for virtual products. Previously, Magento threw this error:  `There are no shipping methods available for you right now. Please try again or use an alternative payment method`.

*  The default PayPal Express Checkout payment method now works as expected with the Braintree Credit Card payment method. Previously, Magento did not display the **PayPal** button when the Braintree Credit Card payment method was enabled.

### Bundle products

<!--- MC-34063-->

*  Magento no longer sets prices for fixed-price bundle product child items in quotes.

<!--- MC-38050-->

*  Price sorting now works as expected when bundle products include out-of-stock products. Previously, sorting price in descending order did not display products in order of decreasing price.

<!--- MC-38576-->

*  Magento now automatically applies a default quantity of 1 for bundle product options when many options exist. Previously, merchants had to manually assign a default quantity to each option.

<!-- ENGCOM-8159 -->

*  The order invoice create page now displays the child products for bundle products as expected. [GitHub-27350](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27350)

<!--- MC-38460 -->

*  Magento now assigns correct product prices when you re-order simple products that are part of a bundle product with a custom price. Previously, setting a custom price on a bundle product resulted in incorrect prices on attached simple products when reordered. [GitHub-30343](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30343)

<!--- MC-30348 -->

*  Calling POST `/V1/order/{orderId}/ship` to ship an order that contains a bundle product now marks the order as complete as expected. Previously, Magento displayed this error message: `You can't create a shipment without products`. [GitHub-9762](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9762)

### Cart and checkout

<!--- MC-34264-->

*  The shipping method estimator now works as expected when custom address attributes are present on the shipping step of the checkout workflow. Previously, Magento displayed this error message: `{"message":"Error occurred during \"custom_attributes\" processing. A custom attribute is specified with a missing attribute code. Verify the code and try again."}` [GitHub-27505](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27505)

<!--- MC-35783-->

*  Magento now displays the `You have no items in your shopping cart` message in the mini cart as expected when a shopper removes the only item in their cart. Previously, cart data was not updated for `checkout/cart/removeFailed` when a shopper removed the single item, and Magento displayed this message: `1 product requires your attention`.

<!--- MC-36088-->

*  Magento no longer displays the cost of shipping for an order for a non-applicable shipping method. Previously, Magento displayed a price of 0 for a non-applicable shipping method in the checkout workflow.

<!--- MC-36598-->

*  A customer’s default billing address is now selected when the **My billing and shipping address are the same** checkbox on the checkout workflow is unselected.

<!--- MC-36685-->

*  Administrators can add a product to a shopping cart by SKU from the Admin without being redirected away from the Admin. The administrator is no longer redirected to a storefront page, and Magento displays the product in the Admin Shopping Cart Items section as expected.

<!--- MC-36750-->

*  Magento now displays informative error messages when you upload a CSV file that contains multiple types of errors when adding products to the cart by SKU. Previously, Magento displayed a blank page and generic error message when you clicked **Choose File** on **Manage Shopping Cart** > **Add to Shopping Cart by SKU**.

<!--- MC-37351-->

*  Cart contents are no longer lost when a shopper switches from one store to another in a different domain.

<!--- MC-38000-->

*  Shoppers can now successfully complete an order using Check Out with Multiple Addresses when using multiple shipping methods. Previously, Magento displayed this error: `There has been an error processing your request`. [GitHub-30197](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30197)

<!--- MC-38048-->

*  Magento now displays the correct default country on the shipping page of the checkout workflow when the shopper changes the store view from the shopping cart.

<!--- MC-38309-->

*  Magento now excludes the current session when cleaning up customer sessions after a post-logout password reset when a guest shopper is logged in. Previously, Magento emptied the shopping cart when the shopper reset their password.

<!--- MC-36884-->

*  Magento now displays the correct default country for a store view when a shopper changes the store view in the shopping cart. Previously, when the store view was changed in the cart, the default country was incorrect.

<!--- MC-38723-->

*  The sequence in which catalog permissions are configured no longer prevents administrators with the correct permissions from adding products to the cart. Previously, Magento did not verify the `addToCart` configuration settings for the current customer group. As a result, when an administrator tried to add a product to the cart, Magento threw an error.

<!--- MC-38746-->

*  Redundant calls to the `/rest/V1/guest-carts/cart_id/totals-information` endpoint on the cart have been removed, which has improved cart performance. Previously, when a shopper added a product to the cart and then subsequently viewed the cart, Magento called the `collectAddressTotals` method multiple times.

<!--- MC-38833-->

*  Magento no longer displays the **Region** field for a country in the checkout workflow when the **Allow to Choose State if It is Optional for Country** setting is disabled. [GitHub-30747](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30747)

<!--- MC-38813-->

*  Magento no longer repeats a shipping address in the storefront checkout workflow when an order is re-ordered from the Admin.

<!--- MC-38814-->

*  Corrected problems with the design of `AdminMediaGalleryInsertLargeImageFileSizeTest`.

<!--- MC-37321-->

*  All new records in the `quote` table for guests are now assigned a value of 1 in the `customer_is_guest field`. Previously, for each new guest who added a product into cart, the record was assigned a 0 in the`quote.customer_is_guest` field.

<!-- ENGCOM-8091 -->

*  The **Submit** button on the Review & Payments section of the checkout workflow has been moved to inside `<form id="purchaseorder-form"...></form>`, which makes implicit form submission possible without altering any JavaScript. [GitHub-27925](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27925)

<!-- ENGCOM-8428 -->

*  Magento no longer displays the **Region** field on the checkout workflow when the **Allow to Choose State if It is Optional for Country** setting is disabled. [GitHub-30747](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30747)

<!-- ENGCOM-8442 -->

*  Magento now correctly updates a cart’s item subtotal when a shopper clicks **Update Shopping Cart** while checking out with multiple addresses. [GitHub-30408](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30408)

<!-- ENGCOM-8283 -->

*  Magento no longer throws an exception when `config.xml` nodes exist for payment methods that are not currently installed. Previously, Magento threw an exception during checkout. [GitHub-29555](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29555)

<!-- ENGCOM-8215 -->

*  Magento now renders product names that contain special characters correctly in the mini cart. [GitHub-29075](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29075)

<!-- ENGCOM-8308 -->

*  Magento now sets the correct discount package for table rate. Previously, Magento did not apply a cart rule that set a discount on the cart when it calculated table rate. [GitHub-30169](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30169)

### Cart price rule

*  Cart price rules are now applied as expected when order subtotals are calculated without incorporating tax. The new `Subtotal (Incl. Tax)` option has been added as a cart price rule condition.

<!--- MC-37884-->

*  Applying a  price rule with a coupon using GraphQL now works as expected when the **Fixed amount discount for whole cart** action is used.

### Catalog

<!--- MC-34100-->

*  Magento now displays all re-enabled products in the storefront as expected. Previously, when a product was disabled and then re-enabled, Magento did not display the product until the Varnish page cache was cleared or the store re-indexed because the page cache was not invalidated after re-enabling a product.

<!--- MC-37745-->

*  Partial re-indexing of large catalogs now works as expected. Previously, products randomly disappeared from the storefront category page  during re-indexing with the `catalogsearch_fulltext` partial indexer.

<!--- MC-35123-->

*  Shoppers can now re-order an invoiced order of a product with customizable options as expected. Previously, Magento threw this error when a shopper tried to re-order: `{"0":"The product's required option(s) weren't entered. Make sure the options are entered and try again`.

<!--- MC-35212-->

*  You can now successfully set the **Layout** setting on the Category Design page to **No layout updates**. Previously, Magento reverted to **Category - FullWidth** when you assigned the **No layout updates** value.

<!--- MC-35490-->

*  Problems with product sort order on the storefront have been resolved. Previously, when Magento indexed product prices, it occasionally set a configurable product’s `min_price` and `max_price` to 0 in the `catalog_product_index_price` table, which affected price sort order on the storefront.

<!--- MC-35608-->

*  Magento now successfully updates attributes that are labeled `Product Type`. Previously, because the `product_type` attribute was reserved in the Magento core code, Magento displayed this message when you tried to update a `Product Type` attribute: `An attribute with the same code (product_type) already exists.`

<!--- MC-36214-->

*  Magento no longer changes the position of an uploaded video in the Images and Videos section of the product details page when you save the product. Previously, the new image position was assigned an index value (position in the list) and if existing image positions were not aligned with their indices values, the new image was misplaced in the list.

<!--- MC-36548-->

*  The **Add to Cart** functionality now works as expected whenever the **Add to Cart** button ia available to click. Previously, if you clicked this button multiple times while waiting for a product page to load, Magento threw this error: `Invalid Form Key. Please refresh the page`.

<!--- MC-37006 36835-->

*  Magento no longer flushes category cache when a merchant adds or removes disabled products to or from a category. Previously, Magento flushed the cache for related categories despite product status. Categories were also unassigned when a category was saved, which led to flushing of category cache.

<!--- MC-37347-->

*  Catalog product filtering within the **All store view** scope now works correctly. Previously, products with a status of either `Enabled` or `Disabled` were displayed in the grid while filtering only enabled or disabled products.

<!--- MC-38038-->

*  Partial re-indexing no longer results in missed products and empty categories.

<!--- MC-38315-->

*  Re-order now works as expected when **Use JavaScript Calendar** is enabled (**Stores** > **Configuration** > **Catalog** > **Date & Time Custom Options**). Previously, when this setting was enabled, Magento displayed this error when you tried to re-order the previously placed order from the Admin: `Please specify date required option(s)`.

<!--- MC-38719-->

*  Magento now displays the correct currency in multi-site deployments during tier price creation.

<!--- MC-38914-->

*  Product image custom attributes are now correctly escaped. The `data-src` attribute has the same value as `src` attribute, as expected. Previously, URL special symbols were escaped.

<!--- MC-37665-->

*  Updating a category through the REST API no longer disables the **Use Default Value** setting on the Enable Category, Include in Menu, and URL Key attributes.

<!--- MC-36832-->

*  Enabling category permissions from the Admin no longer results in a failure to cache category pages in full page cache during repeat visits to the category page. Previously, subsequent visits to the page were not served from the cache as expected, and performance was degraded.

<!--- MC-35363-->

*  Saving a category now flushes only the block cache that is related to this category. Previously, Magento flushed the cache for all category blocks.

<!--- MC-30626-->

*  The price of a custom option with a percent price is now converted as expected into the active store’s base currency in multi-store deployments. Previously, the price of a custom option with a percent price was converted incorrectly. [GitHub-26432](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26432)

<!--- MC-38890-->

*  Magento now recreates images successfully, and these images are visible in the Admin as expected whenever a merchant sends media gallery data using POST `rest/all/V1/products`. Previously, Magento recreated the images but deleted them when a merchant sent media gallery data via POST `rest/all/V1/products` if the images were deleted in `pub/media` but there were still records in media still contained records for these images. As a result, the merchant saw only placeholders in the Admin because the images were created and deleted during the update process.

<!--- MC-36903-->

*  Records are now deleted as expected when you unassigned an item from a website. Previously, images were duplicated when POST `rest/all/V1/products` was executed.

<!--- MC-38413-->

*  The `/V1/categories/{categoryId}/products` call now returns a list of all products that belong to the parent category as expected. Previously, if a product belonged to more than one subcategory of the parent category, Magento threw this type of error: `Internal Error. Details are available in Magento log file. Report ID: webapi-5f8579e37db54`.  [GitHub-30461](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30461)

<!--- MC-32996-->

*  The `/V1/products/attributes/:attributeCode/options` REST endpoint now supports updating an existing attribute option.

<!--- MC-30626 ENGCOM-8475-->

*  The price of a custom option with a percent price is now converted as expected into the active store’s base currency in multi-store deployments. Previously, the price of a custom option with a percent price was converted incorrectly. [GitHub-26432](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26432)

<!-- ENGCOM-8395 -->

*  Merchants can now successfully save a new attribute during product creation. Previously, Magento did not save the attribute and redirected the merchant to the store view home page when they tried to save the attribute. [GitHub-30362](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30362)

<!-- ENGCOM-7997 -->

*  The product grids on the **Sales** > **Orders** and **Catalog** > **Products** pages now list all relevant stores, not just the most recently created store. [GitHub-29267](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29267)

<!-- ENGCOM-6698 -->

*  Product repository now uses `store_id` when available to save attribute values for an existing product.  Previously, the product repository class overrode the product store ID and always assigned the default store ID. [GitHub-29933](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29933)

### Catalog Rule

<!--- MC-35065-->

*  Catalog price rules now work as expected with custom options on product detail pages. Previously, product prices on that page did not reflect applicable catalog price rules. [GitHub-22856](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22856)

<!--- MC-34265-->

*  Product and catalog caches now expire as scheduled. Previously, caches expired daily because `сron` ran the `catalogrule_apply_all` task once daily, which re-indexed all catalog rules and dependent indexers, and cleared the cache for all products and categories.

### Cleanup

#### Typo and grammar cleanup

<!-- ENGCOM-7967 -->

*  The title of the Order Failure page has been revised for accuracy. Previously, this page was titled: **We received your order!**.  [GitHub-29416](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29416)

*  Corrected the position of the button list on the New Attribute page.

<!-- ENGCOM-8315 -->

*  Unused parameters in the construct of the `AdvancedPricing` class have been removed. [GitHub-29531](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29531)

### Configurable products

<!--- MC-35016-->

*  Filtering out-of-stock configurable products by price now displays results within the correct price range.

<!--- MC-38930-->

*  A virtual product no longer changes type when its status is changed from enabled to disabled (or vice versa). Previously, Magento changed a product’s type from virtual to simple when its status changed.

<!--- MC-38197-->

*  The `getValue()` method no longer triggers a fatal error when updating carts.

<!--- MC-34444-->

*  Configurable products that are available on multiple websites no longer show simple child products that are not assigned to the specific website. [GitHub-28291](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28291)

<!-- ENGCOM-8202 -->

*  Storefront product pages now display tier prices without taxes as expected. [GitHub-12225](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12225)

<!-- ENGCOM-8134 8174-->

*  MSRP prices for configurable products are now converted to the chosen currency correctly. Previously, Magento displayed prices in the wrong currency and threw this error:  `Call to a member function setAppliedTaxes() on null`. [GitHub-26526](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26526), [GitHub-29603](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29603)

<!-- ENGCOM-8234 -->

*  Merchants can now save a store-specific text swatch attribute option label with a value  of 0 (zero). Previously, a value of 0 was replaced with the Admin label option value. [GitHub-30073](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30073)

<!-- ENGCOM-8117 -->

*  Unused parameters in the construct of the `AdvancedPricing` class have been removed. [GitHub-29531](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29531)

### cron

<!--- MC-37712-->

*  The System Message list now accurately reflects product updates after `cron` has run and Magento has updated products as scheduled.

<!-- ENGCOM-8164 -->

*  An index based on `schedule_id` and `status` has been added to the `cron_schedule` table. [GitHub-29601](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29601)

### Custom customer attributes

<!--- MC-23545-->

*  Magento now displays customer attributes of type `file` on the Account Information page after creation. Previously, when you tried to save a new attribute of this type, Magento displayed these errors: `The "newAttribute" attribute value is empty. Set the attribute and try again` and `Validation is failed`.

<!--- MC-23544-->

*  Magento now correctly displays multi-line custom customer attribute values. Previously, not all data was displayed.

<!--- MC-36978-->

*  Magento now alerts shoppers when they enter an invalid birth date while creating an account. Previously, the validator disregarded locale settings, and shoppers were redirected to the Create New Customer Account Page with an invalid date error.

<!--- MC-38846-->

*  Custom address attributes are now included as expected in the Payment step of the checkout workflow.

<!--- MC-38114-->

*  Custom address multi-select attributes are now correctly displayed during guest checkout and on the Admin and My Account order details page.

<!--- MC-37581-->

*  Custom address attributes are now displayed correctly in the My account area and Admin order details page.

<!--- MC-37101-->

*  You can now delete a leading zero in a custom customer attribute when `Input Type` is set to `Text` and `Input Validation` is set to `Numeric Only`.

<!--- MC-36721-->

*  Magento now successfully exports customer data that includes a custom gender attribute value.

<!--- MC-34650-->

*  Magento now saves custom customer attribute values for B2B users as expected. Previously, custom customer attributes created for adding or editing company users were not bound with the Add New User form, and as a result, attribute values were not saved. In addition, the custom date attribute was derived from the database as a string and was not converted to proper date format for storefront display.

### Customer

<!--- MC-35771-->

*  The calendar widget for the storefront customer account page date of birth field now uses the designated store locale.

<!--- MC-38498-->

*  Magento no longer saves duplicate entries of a customer address during checkout of a re-order for an existing customer from the Admin.

<!--- MC-37393-->

*  Deleting all addresses from multiple customers from the Admin now deletes all addresses from the customer address list and removes default billing and shipping addresses. Previously, Magento deleted the address from the customer address list but did not remove the default billing and shipping addresses.

<!--- MC-37377-->

*  The Admin customer address tab now correctly displays address count after an administrator has performed a mass deletion of addresses. Previously, Magento included deleted addresses in its count.

<!--- MC-36718-->

*  The DateTime format for the **Date of Birth** field on the customer registration page has been corrected. Previously, the leading zero that preceded a single-digit day was missing.

<!--- MC-36024-->

*  Date format validation for the **Date of Birth** field now works before the shopper clicks the **Create an account** button. Previously, a shopper could enter a value in an invalid format, and when they clicked the **Create an account** button, the shopper was redirected to the Create New Customer Account Page with an invalid date error.

<!--- MC-33867-->

*  Magento no longer throws a fatal error when an administrator tries to save a new customer account that contains invalid data for an attribute.

<!--- MC-36258-->

*  Magento no longer throws a 400 error when a customer tries to access their shopping cart in a deployment where Magento Shipping was previously installed and the default Luma theme is currently deployed. Previously, Magento did not filter out section names that were created by previously installed/enabled modules that were not supported in the Admin before sending requests to the server, which generated errors.

<!--- MC-35812-->

*  Magento now displays a message as expected when a shopper creates a guest account when the **Require Emails Confirmation** setting is enabled and `Magento\Customer\Controller\Account\CreatePost` has been overridden. Previously, Magento did not permit this type of customization of the user registration process, and under these conditions, a user's email confirmation status was considered complete, the new user was automatically logged in, and no error message was shown.

<!-- ENGCOM-8039 -->

*  Magento now assigns a shopper to the correct customer group when the shopper places an order with a non-default customer group in a store where **Enable Automatic Assignment to Customer Group** is enabled. [GitHub-26976](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26976)

<!--- MC-39783-->

*  The Admin customers grid is now available as expected when the non-default website is deleted in a multi-site deployment when indexes are set to **Update by Schedule**. Previously, Magento did not display the grid and threw this error:  `[2020-12-09 11:31:54] report.CRITICAL: The website with id 2 that was requested wasn't found. Verify the website and try again. \{"exception":"[object] (Magento\\Framework\\Exception\\NoSuchEntityException(code: 0): The website with id 2 that was requested wasn't found. Verify the website and try again. at /var/www/html/magento24ee/vendor/magento/module-store/Model/WebsiteRepository.php:110)”}`

### dotdigital

*  Error handling has been improved when retrieving lists of programs from dotdigital Engagement Cloud.

*  The value that is synced in the store name column during guest sync is now the store view name as expected. Previously, the website name was included in this column.

*  Added an array check before looping over order status automations after an order is saved.

*  Resolved issues with Composer upgrades that were the result of the dotdigital module’s dependency on `magento/module-authorization`.

### Downloadable

<!-- ENGCOM-7679 -->

*  Magento no longer lists a downloadable product in My Download Products tab after the downloadable product has been partially refunded. [GitHub-28388](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28388)

### Dynamic block (formerly banner)

<!--- MC-23938-->

*  Magento no longer displays a dynamic block on the storefront after you have deleted the customer segment that is associated with the block.

<!--- MC-37322-->

*  Magento now correctly takes into account catalog price rules when determining whether to display a dynamic block.

### EAV

<!--- MC-35934-->

*  Custom attributes that use `\Magento\Eav\Model\Entity\Attribute\Backend\ArrayBackend` now use default values if no value is provided in the payload when a product is created by API call.

### Email

<!-- ENGCOM-7961 -->

*  `\Magento\Config\Model\Config\Source\Email\Template::toOptionArray` no longer throws an error when `setPath()` is not called before `toOptionArray()`. [GitHub-29315](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29315)

<!--- MC-36777-->

*  Magento now correctly converts plain text to HTML when you click **Return Html Version** when loading an email template.

<!--- MC-34803-->

*  Email sent to customers that contain partial invoices now includes accurate item subtotals. Previously, the subtotal in this email was the total of the ordered quantity, not the total amount of the invoiced quantity.

<!--- MC-38337-->

*  Magento now sends email reminders to all relevant customers with valid email addresses. Previously, Magento stopped sending reminder emails to customers after encountering one invalid address.

<!-- ENGCOM-7517 -->

*  Sending sales email in asynchronous mode now works as  expected after a product is removed from a catalog. Previously, asynchronous email sending was blocked, and Magento displayed this error:  `main.ERROR: Cron Job sales_send_order_invoice_emails has an error: Call to a member function getData() on null. Statistics: {"sum":0,"count":1,"realmem":0,"emalloc":0,"realmem_start":73400320,"emalloc_start":37177640} [] []main.CRITICAL: Error when running a cron job {"exception":"[object] (RuntimeException(code: 0): Error when running a cron job at /var/www/html/vendor/magento/module-cron/Observer/ProcessCronQueueObserver.php:327, Error(code: 0): Call to a member function getData() on null at /var/www/html/vendor/magento/module-catalog/Helper/Image.php:502)"} []`. [GitHub-26878](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26878)

<!-- ENGCOM-8381 -->

*  Magento no longer copies a customer on order confirmation email when `sales_email/order_comment/enabled` is disabled and `sales_email/order_comment/copy_method` is set to `bcc`. [GitHub-29915](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29915)

### Frameworks

<!--- MC-24195-->

*  Customized filter groups are now applied correctly when searching on customers. Previously, the `afterSearch` function did not OR filters as expected. [GitHub-24576](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24576)

<!--- MC-36942-->

*  Images on a store’s home page are now rendered successfully. Previously, the page source HTML was corrupted because the three consecutive slashes in the image’s base64 code was misinterpreted as a comment.

<!--- MC-37369-->

*  DatePicker now works correctly when filtering orders on the Admin Orders list in stores using the Arabic locale (`ar_SA - Saudi Arabia`).

<!--- MC-38344-->

*  DatePicker now displays the correct date after a merchant saves a cart price rule in a deployment. [GitHub-30382](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30382)

<!--- MC-31085-->

*  Magento now correctly represents Arabic thousands grouping and Arabic decimal separator symbols. Previously, Arabic symbols were trimmed. [GitHub-26676](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26676)

<!--- MC-30631-->

*  Magento now deletes expired database sessions from the database `session` table as expected.

### General fixes

<!--- MC-38105-->

*  You can now configure a native session handler that differs from the handler that is defined in `php.ini`. Previously, `SessionManager` did not set the memcache as `save_handler`, but instead used the file’s `session_handler`. Magento threw this error: `main.CRITICAL: Warning: SessionHandler::read(): open(127.0.0.1:11211/sess_0imeeaqmnvemdg4e3h57tat0ik, O_RDWR) failed: No such file or directory (2) in../vendor/magento/framework/Session/SaveHandler/Native.php on line 22 {"exception":"[object] (Exception(code: 0): Warning: SessionHandler::read(): open(127.0.0.1:11211/sess_0imeeaqmnvemdg4e3h57tat0ik, O_RDWR) failed: No such file or directory (2) in ../vendor/magento/framework/Session/SaveHandler/Native.php on line 22 at ../vendor/magento/framework/App/ErrorHandler.php:61)”}`. [GitHub-24717](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24717)

<!-- ENGCOM-8052 -->

*  The following improvements have been made to the `LoginAsCustomer` modules:

   *  Replaced the `around` plug-in with `after`

   *  Removed redundant code

   *  Replaced `(bool)->getValue()` with `isSetFlag`. [GitHub-29689](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29689)

<!-- ENGCOM-8093 -->

*  Reloading all customer-data sections by wildcard (*) no longer causes requests to `customer/section/load` to throw a 400 error. [GitHub-28154](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28154)

<!-- ENGCOM-7994 -->

*  Magento now passes exceptions that occur when a layout is rendered in production mode to `var/report`. [GitHub-29606](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29606)

<!--- MC-38587-->

*  Magento no longer redirects customers to the home page when changing store view. The `\Magento\VersionsCmsUrlRewrite\Model\StoreSwitcher::switch()` method now redirects shoppers to the home page only when `$urlPath` is not found for the second store view.

<!-- ENGCOM-7527 -->

*  Magento now throws an exception when a customer who does not exist requests a password reset. [GitHub-26288](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26288)

<!--- MC-33687 ENGCOM-8497-->

*  Magento now displays an informative error message when an administrator tries to save a customer account that contains an invalid value for a customer attribute  while uploading a file that this attribute value.

<!-- ENGCOM-8395 -->

*  Magento now opens the New Attribute page as expected when a merchant clicks the **Create New Attribute** button twice during product creation. Previously, Magento displayed an empty page and threw an error. [GitHub-30361](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30361)

<!-- ENGCOM-8426 -->

*  Magento no longer displays the `The coupon code has been accepted` message after a coupon has been removed. [GitHub-30255](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30255)

<!-- ENGCOM-8396 -->

*  Administrators can now assign widgets to specific categories. [GitHub-30009](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30009)

<!-- ENGCOM-8216 -->

<!-- ENGCOM-8282 -->

*  Magento now displays store-specific values that are associated with custom category  attributes as expected. [GitHub-13440](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13440)

<!-- ENGCOM-8287 -->

*  Magento now displays a prompt asking whether the customer group should be changed when you click the **Validate VAT Number** button on the order creation page when the store address and shipping destination belong to different EU countries. [GitHub-29652](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29652)

<!-- ENGCOM-8031 -->

*  The `\Magento\Catalog\Model\ImageUploader` class has been refactored to use the new `moveFileFromTmp`  method. [GitHub-29598](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29598)

<!-- ENGCOM-8178 -->

*  Magento now displays a more informative error message when a merchant tries to create a product attribute with `product_type` and `type_id` codes to be more descriptive. [GitHub-28479](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28479)

<!-- ENGCOM-8135 -->

*  Corrected validation logic for the **Customer Token Lifetime (hours)**  and **Admin Token Lifetime (hours)** fields  on the Admin **Stores**  >  **Configurations** >  **Services**  > **OAuth** page. [GitHub-29502](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29502)

<!-- ENGCOM-8132 -->

*  Magento now correctly parses text that contains `}}` in the widget content field. [GitHub-12087](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12087)

<!-- ENGCOM-8098 -->

*  You can now remove a filter from the Product Categories page. Previously, when you tried to delete the filter, Magento did not let you remove the filter and displayed this error:  `Something went wrong`. [GitHub-8538](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8538)

<!-- ENGCOM-8050 -->

*  `Magento\Framework\MessageQueue\ConfigInterface` can now be instantiated when optional module `Magento_MessageQueue` is disabled. Previously, Magento threw this error: `PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Cannot instantiate interface Magento\Framework\MessageQueue\ConfigInterface in /var/www/magento2/magento2/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/ObjectManager/Factory/AbstractFactory.php:121`. [GitHub-26080](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26080)

<!-- ENGCOM-7312 -->

*  Logic that determines when Magento can retrieve email value from persistent storage has been improved. Previously, Magento displayed populated password fields on the checkout page when an unregistered user returned to the checkout page after first completing the email field. [GitHub-26903](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26903)

<!-- ENGCOM-7777 -->

*  A missing `aclResource` attribute has been added to the Admin header `AdminNotification` toolbar block. Previously, the Admin notification toolbar entry was visible even when the Admin user does not have role resource permissions to see it. [GitHub-29067](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29067)

<!-- ENGCOM-8022 -->

*  The `framework/database/select` `where` functions now handle `type` correctly. [GitHub-29590](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29590)

<!-- ENGCOM-8260 -->

*  Inefficient use of `array_merge` in loops has been improved throughout the codebase, which has improved performance in several places, including in the static content deployment process. [GitHub-30183](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30183)

<!-- ENGCOM-8445 -->

*  The default Admin session lifetime has been moved from the encryption module to the security module. [GitHub-30859](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30859)

<!-- ENGCOM-8425 -->

*  Magento now checks for private constants in a class and displays a warning if there are any `static::` calls to them. Previously, Magento threw this error: `Undefined class constant`.

<!-- ENGCOM-8219 -->

*  Added rules to `editorconfig` to support indenting JSON and YAML files two spaces. [GitHub-30066](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30066), [GitHub-30063](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30063)

<!-- ENGCOM-8079 -->

*  The `FlushCacheByTags` class has been updated to use after-plug-ins instead of around-plug-ins. [GitHub-29558](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29558)

<!-- ENGCOM-8358 -->

*  `MessageValidator` no longer fails on hash arrays that do not include a `0` element. [GitHub-30563](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30563)

<!-- ENGCOM-8370 -->

*  Code in the `checkout_index_index.xml` file has been enhanced by the removal of `sortOrder` from `messages`, `authentication`, `progressBar`, `estimation`, and `sidebar checkout` components. [GitHub-30550](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30550)

<!-- ENGCOM-8379 -->

*  Content in `calc` is now escaped, which results in correct `calc` values in the CSS output file. Previously,  Magento returned an incorrect `calc` value. [GitHub-30542](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30542)

<!-- ENGCOM-8030 -->

*  The URL rewrite generator now sets the  category object `url_key`, `url_path`, and  `store_id` to default store values when saving category URL rewrites for the global scope. Previously, it saved `url_key`, `url_path`, and `store_id` with the values of the last processed store ID. [GitHub-29585](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29585)

<!-- ENGCOM-8250 -->

*  `\Magento\Widget\Controller\Adminhtml\Widget\Instance\Validate` now recognizes a phrase result value as an error message and outputs it to the user during widget validation. [GitHub-27397](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27397)

<!-- ENGCOM-8311 -->

*  The hard-coded list of category attributes in  `Magento\Catalog\Model\Category\DataProvider::getFieldsMap()` has been replaced with a list of attributes that are generated from cache. [GitHub-13440](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13440)

<!-- ENGCOM-7759 -->

*  Redundant hashing of `req.http.host/client.ip` has been removed and hashing is handled by the Varnish built-in VCL. [GitHub-29988](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29988)

<!-- ENGCOM-8302 -->

*  Added a failure callback to the `Magento_Ui` file uploader. [GitHub-29557](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29557)

<!-- ENGCOM-8405 -->

*  An `acl.xml` inconsistency that occurred when `Magento_LoginAsCustomerAssistance` was enabled but `Magento_LoginAsCustomerAdminUi` or `Magento_LoginAsCustomerLog` were disabled has been corrected. Previously, when administrator with these credentials tried to log in to the Admin, Magento displayed a blank page and threw this error when :  `Exception #0 (LogicException): Could not create an acl object: Invalid Document Element 'resource': The attribute 'title' is required but missing. Line: 13`. [GitHub-30680](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30680)

<!-- ENGCOM-8157 -->

*  Magento no longer throws an `Undefined class constant` error when an `Interceptor` is generated during plug-in creation. [GitHub-28981](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28981), [GitHub-29879](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29879)

<!-- ENGCOM-8108 -->

*  Magento now correctly handles messaging and logging for asynchronous bulk operations. Previously, although products were updated, the `magento_operation` and `queue_message_status` tables were not updated correctly, and system messages were incorrect. [GitHub-29718](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29718)

<!-- ENGCOM-8388 -->

*  A shopper is now redirected to the Set a New Password page as expected when they click **Set a New Password** in the Reset Password email when **Require Emails Confirmation** is enabled for the store. Previously, the shopper was redirected back to the **Forgot Your Password** button on the login page. [GitHub-27954](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27954)

<!-- ENGCOM-8337 -->

*  Corrected array to string conversion error when saving row system configuration with default values. [GitHub-30314](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30314)

<!-- ENGCOM-8440 -->

*  You can now set arguments for message queues. [GitHub-30216](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30216)

<!-- ENGCOM-8384 -->

*  The base file collector now respects `AppState->emulateAreaCode()`. [GitHub-39656](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29656)

<!-- ENGCOM-8441 -->

*  The new `BlockByIdentifier` class supports retrieving a layout block based on CMS block identifier. As a result, when a CMS block is removed from cache, Magento also clears the layout block cache. [GitHub-28309](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28309)

<!-- ENGCOM-8385 -->

*  Corrected problems with numeric argument conversion in queues. Previously, when you declared a queue with numeric `type` arguments in the `queue_topology.xml`, the argument value was cast to string. [GitHub-29615](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29615)

## Gift cards

<!--- MC-38989-->

*  Emails that contain a gift card code are now sent only after the order has been successfully saved when the **Create a gift card account when an order item is ordered** configuration setting is enabled. Previously, a gift card code was re-used and sent to different customers if a gift card account were generated when items were ordered but an exception occurred after the virtual gift card was sent.

<!--- MC-36496-->

*  Magento no longer duplicates gift card orders. Previously, when a shopper ordered one gift card, Magento delivered two gift codes. This occurred because `cron` jobs called `\Magento\GiftCard\Observer\GenerateGiftCardAccountsInvoice::execute()`, and this method did not check whether gift card codes had already been generated during invoice creation.

<!--- MC-35058-->

*  Merchants can now unassign products from categories as expected. Previously, Magento threw an error similar to this error: `Could not save product "4" with position 0 to category 3`.

<!-- ENGCOM-8326 -->

*  Added support for symlinked Magento `root` in errors pages and maintenance mode. Previously, if the Magento `root` or `magento/pub` were symlinked into a different directory,  the error processor (`Magento\Framework\Error\Processor`) did not generate a correct view file URL. [GitHub-30296](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30296)

<!-- ENGCOM-8087 -->

*  Added missing `order_data` array to `EmailSender` classes. This brings these classes into alignment with Magento’s recommendation to use scalar variables instead of objects within the email templates. [GitHub-29604](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29604)

### Google Tag Manager

<!--- MC-34818-->

*  The Google Tag Manager `productClick` function now works as expected. Previously, `productClick` was not triggered on products on listing pages, and Google Tag Manager could not capture that event.

<!--- MC-38781-->

*  Google Tag Manager configurable product options now update as expected in the datalayer after you edit a configurable product options in the cart. Previously, the data for the `removeFromCart` event was incorrectly rewritten when the product option was changed, and the quantity remained the same.

### GraphQL

<!--- MC-37615-->

*  The `urlResolver` query now handles query parameters correctly.

<!-- ENGCOM-8422 -->

*  The `urlResolver` query no longer returns NULL when a custom CMS node and page are specified as input. [GitHub-30474](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30474)

<!--- MC-38209 ENGCOM-8386-->

*  The `category` query no longer returns child categories of a parent category that has been disabled. [GitHub-30468](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30468)

<!--- MC-38407-->

*  The `category` query now returns the correct path of a category image when URL rewrites are disabled.

<!--- MC-36648 8321-->

*  The `resetPassword` mutation now returns a more informative message when an error occurs. [GitHub-30179](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30179)

<!--- MC-38078 ENGCOM-8504-->

*  Cached results of the `products` query are invalidated as expected when product positions change. [GitHub-30467](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30467)

<!--- MC-35355 ENGCOM-8404-->

*  The `products` query now returns the expected results when the `category_id` filter is specified with the `in` keyword. [GitHub-30349](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30349)

<!-- ENGCOM-8373 -->

*  The `categories` and `categoryList` queries now consider category availability based on category permissions configuration and parent category ID. [GitHub-29880](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29880), [GitHub-30624](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30624)

<!--- MC-37603-->

*  The `updateProductsInWishList` mutation now properly validates wishlist items. [GitHub-30467](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30467)

<!-- ENGCOM-8430 PWA-1107-->

*  Deprecated several attributes in the `ProductInterface` and `CategoryInterface` to prevent their use on the storefront. [GitHub-30625](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30625)

*  Prices are now hidden from products query results when the category permissions are set to hide them. [GitHub-29926](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29926)

<!--- MC-36898 PWA-1299-->

*  You can now use the `addProductsToWishList` mutation to add a bundle product with a user-defined quantity to a wishlist.

<!--- MC-36648 -->

*  The mutations that add products to a cart now honor catalog permissions. [GitHub-30179](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30179)

<!--- MC-36946 -->

*  GraphQL response time for add to cart operations has improved.

<!-- ENGCOM-8099 -->

*  The `products` query now returns tier price values as expected. [GitHub-29168](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29168)

<!-- ENGCOM-7528 -->

*  Removed a redundant `getMappedNums` from a loop in `lib/internal/Magento/Framework/GraphQl/Query/EnumLookup.php`. [GitHub-30031](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30031)

<!-- ENGCOM-8172 -->

*  The `products` query no longer returns an error when the queried product has a disabled related product. [GitHub-28892](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28892)

<!--- MC-37395 -->

*  The `cart` query now returns prices that have been converted into the correct currency (the default display currency). Previously, the query returned the item price value in base currency, and the currency code was returned as default display currency.

<!--- MC-37388-->

*  GraphQL now honors catalog permissions. Magento restricts which items are returned for a `products` query based on the shopper's customer group.

<!--- MC-39690-->

*  Added the `customizable_option` attribute to multiple data types that implement the `CartItemInterface`.

<!--- MC-39744-->

*  Added attributes for the `storeConfig` query to return store, store group, and website information.

<!--- MC-37414-->

*  Reinstated the `SelectedCustomizableOption.type` attribute. In addition, the `customizable_options` attribute within various implementations of the `CartItemInterface` are now non-null.

<!--- MC-23860-->

*  The search functionality of the `products` query no longer returns items in which category permissions have been enabled.

<!--- MC-37726-->

*  The `products` query returns the correct currency for store views that have multiple currencies.

<!--- MC-37727-->

*  Labels for `products` query filters now return translated values, when applicable for non default store views.

<!--- MC-37728-->

*  Fixed store currency amounts on gift cards in the cart.

<!--- MC-38443-->

*  Added the `ConfigurableProductOptionsSelection` data type, which contains metadata corresponding to the selectable configurable options for a product. Use this object in a `products` query to minimize the number of media gallery items that are displayed as the shopper selects configurable product options.

### Grouped products

<!--- MC-35361-->

*  The products query now returns all expected data for grouped products. Previously, `product_links` was an empty array.

<!--- MC-37718-->

*  A grouped product is now listed as out-of-stock on the product edit page when all child simple products are out-of-stock.

<!--- MC-37249-->

*  The status of a grouped product now updates correctly on the product edit page when the status of its child simple products changes to out-of-stock. Previously, the inventory stock item for the parent of the grouped product did not update after its children changed stock status.

### Images

<!--- MC-36942-->

*  Images on a store’s home page are now rendered successfully. Previously, the page source HTML was corrupted because the three consecutive slashes in the image’s base64 code were misinterpreted as a comment.

<!-- ENGCOM-8116 -->

*  The dependency on the `fileinfo` extension has been removed from the CMS module. Previously, Magento threw an error when you tried to upload an image using the image uploader, which is launched when you click the **Insert Image** button when adding content. [GitHub-24332](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24332), [GitHub-16531](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/16531), [GitHub-29852](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29852)

<!-- ENGCOM-8020 -->

*  Added support for reading `exif_image.png` or `exif-image.jpeg` metadata. [GitHub-1449](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1449)

<!--- MC-37042-->

*  Images are now displayed by the Catalog Events Carousel widget after upload as expected. Previously, the `catalog_event_status_checker` cron job deleted uploaded images.

<!-- ENGCOM-8296 -->

*  CMYK images colors  are now rendered correctly. When the Imagick adapter now detects that an opened image has a CMYK colorspace, the colorspace is converted to SRGB. Previously, these images were rendered with inverted colors. [GitHub-22375](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22375)

<!-- ENGCOM-8251 -->

*  Boolean values are no longer set for `image_with_border.phtml`. Redundant `max-width` and `height` settings have been removed from `.product-image-photo`. (These values are already set globally on the image through the reset styles.) [GitHub-30186](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30186)

### Import/export

<!--- MC-35081-->

*  Customer address `region_id` is no longer assigned a `NULL` value when you import customer addresses using a CSV file (`entity type = "customer address"` and `import behavior = "add/update”`) from which certain field values have been deleted.

<!--- MC-35295-->

*  You can now hide product images on the storefront during import.

<!--- MC-35395-->

*  A scheduled product import process now updates products with correct data fields when the CSV file also contains incorrect entries. Previously, no entries were updated if the CSV file included incorrect entries when **On Error: Continue Processing** was enabled.

<!--- MC-35836-->

*  When an imported product has `qty` set to 0 but `is_in_stock set` to 1 in the CSV file, the product is not listed on the category page, and the product details page identifies it as out-of-stock. Previously, products with these values were visible on the storefront after import.

<!--- MC-38433-->

*  CSV import no longer ignores the `dropdown` and `textarea` values for additional attributes. Previously, these attribute values were not updated during import.

<!--- MC-37933-->

*  The product export CSV file now appears in the Admin list of export CSV files as expected. Previously, Magento threw an error when you ran this command: `bin/magento queue:consumers:start exportProcessor --single-thread --max-messages=10000`.

<!--- MC-37672-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when importing CSV data that includes Bengali (Bangla) alphabet characters.

<!--- MC-36410-->

*  Magento now displays an informative error message when an administrator clicks **Check Data** during import of a file that has been changed since export when working in Chrome. Previously, Magento displayed a console error but did not tell the user how to proceed.

<!-- ENGCOM-8252 -->

*  Magento no longer duplicates product images when you import the same product CSV data more than once. [GitHub-21885](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21885)

<!-- ENGCOM-8262 -->

*  The limit of 90 characters for image file names  in `vendor/magento/framework/File/Uploader.php` has been removed.  Previously, directory and file name length could not exceed 255 characters. Magento imported products with images whose file name exceeded this limit, but did not import the image file. [GitHub-29377](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29377)

<!-- ENGCOM-8153 -->

*  Coupon codes can now be successfully exported to CSV or XML. Previously, Magento displayed a 404 error when you clicked **Export CSV** or **Export XML** when you tried to export coupons. [GitHub-29277](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29277)

<!-- ENGCOM-8252 -->

*  Duplicated product images are now removed after importing a CSV file that contains images. [GitHub-14398](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14398), [GitHub-21885](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21885)

## Index

<!--- MC-38003-->

*  We have improved the performance of the partial indexer. Magento now clears the cache IDs that were changed for each 1000-ID batch iteration. Cache context no longer accumulate IDs. Previously, cache context accumulated cache IDs for each 1000-ID batch iteration and cleared the same set of IDs on each iteration.

<!-- ENGCOM-7929 -->

*  Inconsistencies between the partial re-indexing system and the full re-indexing system have been corrected. Both indexing systems now use the same code, which works correctly. Previously, both indexing systems used different logic in regards to the shared indexers, which potentially caused indexers to be invalidated after every run of the partial re-indexing system. [GitHub-29478](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29478), [GitHub-29297](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29297)

<!--- MC-38168-->

*  We have resolved issues with the manual indexer that had resulted in either empty category pages or reduced product count on category pages. Issues with incomplete category pages or product count occurred when:

   *  the `catalogsearch_fulltext` and `catalog_product_price` partial indexers were executed on a large catalog until these indexers completed execution.

   *  the partial indexer was executed on either `catalog_category_product` or `catalog_product_category` indices, and at the same time a full re-index was executed on one of those indices. These two indexing processes could conflict, which resulted in products missing from category pages.

   *  `bin/magento indexer:reindex inventory` was executed on a large catalog. Products were missing from category pages until the `catalogsearch_fulltext` partial indexer completed execution.

<!--- MC-39700-->

*  An indexer has been added to the `Magento_Bulk` MySQL table, which has improved the performance of bulk operations.

<!--- MC-38806-->

*  Comments in database tables now accurately reflect table status after re-indexing (`bin/magento indexer:reindex`). Previously, table comments after re-indexing contained the same values that comments contained after a fresh installation.

<!-- ENGCOM-7542 -->

*  The `SELECT entity_id IN` statement has been improved in deployments implementing MariaDB v.10.3.18, which has improved the performance of catalog category indexing. [GitHub-25199](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25199)

<!-- ENGCOM-8237 -->

*  Magento has improved cache performance by eliminating the flushing of tags multiple times per indexer instance. [GitHub-29890](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29890)

### Infrastructure

<!--- MC-34353-->

*  You can now use `app/etc/env.php` to change the message broker from MYSQL to AMQP.

<!--- MC-38242-->

*  Issues with the calculation of remainders for decimal values for product quantities have been corrected in the relevant JavaScript library. Magento previously calculated decimal fractions of more than two digits incorrectly and subsequently displayed an incorrect message.

<!--- MC-38993 ENGCOM-8473-->

*  The `\Magento\Authorization\Model\Rules::update` method has been deprecated. [GitHub-29128](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29128)

<!-- ENGCOM-8000 -->

*  Magento no longer throws a fatal error when converting a date object from UTC. Previously, under certain conditions, the `convertConfigTimeToUtc` method threw an exception. [GitHub-29525](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29525)

<!-- ENGCOM-7987 -->

*  `DataObject` has been replaced with the product model in `\Magento\MediaGalleryCatalogUi\Ui\Component\Listing\Columns\Thumbnail::prepareDataSource`.[GitHub-1711](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1711)

<!-- ENGCOM-7914 -->

*  The `RequireJS` resolver no longer fails to detect blocked resources. Previously, the resolver did not correctly detect whether all resources on a page were loaded or handled appropriately, and the page kept loading. [GitHub-28116](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28116)

<!-- ENGCOM-8229 -->

*  Attribute Repository code validation now respects `Magento\Eav\Model\Entity\Attribute::ATTRIBUTE_CODE_MAX_LENGTH` rather than a hard-coded value. [GitHub-29017](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29017)

<!--- MC-35699-->

*  HTML minification no longer strips triple slashes (///) from HTML strings in PHTML files. Previously, triple slashes were interpreted as comments during minification, and the rest of the line was completely removed in the generated PHTML file upon deployment.

<!--- MC-38201-->

*  Merchants can now configure indexer subscriptions on the table column level rather than the table level. A new argument has been added to `\Magento\Framework\Mview\View\Subscription` to allow columns to be ignored for a specific view or table combination. [GitHub-30243](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30243)

<!--- MC-30171-->

*  Clicking the **Add to Cart** button  before the product page JavaScript has fully initialized no longer results in duplicate `form_key` values. Previously, a product could be added to the cart with a cached `form_key` value that triggered an exception. When **Add to Cart** was clicked before the JavaScript had fully initialized, then the `form_key` value that was sent in the form data did not match the users session, and the product was not added to the cart. [GitHub-13746](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13746)

<!-- ENGCOM-8107 -->

*  The current cURL client now respects case-insensitive header names. Previously, the `Set-Cookie` comparison was case-sensitive, which could cause problems with some HTTP servers. [GitHub-29524](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29524)

<!-- ENGCOM-8360 -->

*  Updated XSD URN format in `api-functional` and test case XML files. [GitHub-30552](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30552)

<!-- ENGCOM-8295 -->

*  An event prefix and event object has been added to the catalog product option value collection to improve customization of the collection loading of `\Magento\Catalog\Model\ResourceModel\Product\Option\Value\Collection`. [GitHub-29621](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29621)

<!-- ENGCOM-8261 -->

*  All occurrences of `array_merge` have been refactored to use the format recommended in the Magento coding standard. [GitHub-30005](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30005)

<!-- ENGCOM-7718 -->

*  A `head.additional` block of type `\Magento\Framework\View\Element\Text\ListText` has been added to the `adminhtml` `default` layout (by `magento2/module-base`). [GitHub-29165](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29165)

<!-- ENGCOM-8312 -->

*  Added missing escape URL method to the layout template module widget. [GitHub-30036](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30036)

<!-- ENGCOM-8127 -->

*  The `\Magento\Framework\Filesystem\Io\File::read()` method is now compatible with `\Magento\Framework\Filesystem\Io\IoInterface::read()`. [GitHub-27866](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27866)

### Klarna

*  Removed the dependency on the PayPal module. [GitHub-29421](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29421)

### Logging

<!-- ENGCOM-8443 -->

*  The `Magento_Logging` module now correctly registered new values as well as the values that preceded them. Previously, the values in the column Value Before Change displayed values of N/A regardless of whether this was the first change or the next, or when the default value was returned. [GitHub-26943](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26943)

### Media Gallery

<!-- ENGCOM-8014 -->

*  The Admin **Stores**  >  **Configuration**  >  **Advanced**  >  **System** page has been updated to display the correct product name (Media Gallery). Minor redesigns to the user interface have been included. [GitHub-1738](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1738)

<!-- ENGCOM-8019 -->

*  Links in the Used in section of Media Gallery image descriptions now display a grid that has been filtered by the selected image as expected. Previously, the displayed grid was not correctly titled, and list entries were not accurate. [GitHub-1694](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1694)

<!-- ENGCOM-8019 -->

*  You can now successfully edit multiple images in the Media Gallery. Previously, you could not add tags to a second image after adding tags to one image. [GitHub-1755](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1755)

<!-- ENGCOM-8015 -->

*  The Tags drop-down menu is now empty as expected after you remove tags from an image in the Media Gallery. [GitHub-1703](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1703)

<!-- ENGCOM-8146 -->

*  Batch processing for Media Gallery synchronization queue messages is now supported. [GitHub-1724](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1724)

<!-- ENGCOM-8064 -->

*  Magento now displays a 404 page as expected when you try to open the Media Gallery when **Enhanced Media Gallery** is disabled.  [GitHub-1760](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1760)

<!-- ENGCOM-8072 -->

*  `MediaGalleryMetadata` now skips the segment reader if an exception occurs and instead parses and displays image metadata as expected. Previously, the image metadata was empty due to an exception from the `exif_read_data` segment reader. [GitHub-1782](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1782)

<!-- ENGCOM-8069 -->

*  Folder name length no longer prevents an image from being uploaded to the Media Gallery. Media Gallery now sets path column as type `text`. [GitHub-1778](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1778)

<!-- ENGCOM-8217 -->

*  Image uploader now displays the correct image size when a rendition is inserted from Media Gallery. [GitHub-1806](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1806)

<!-- ENGCOM-8467 -->

*  Path verification has been added to the `Mediagallery` uploader plug-in. Previously, validation failed, and Magento did not import products when **Enable Old Media Gallery** was disabled. [GitHub-30649](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30649)

<!-- ENGCOM-8057 -->

*  `Magento_Cms::media_gallery` ACL subresources have been added and enforced for the new Media Gallery to support configured permissions for the following discrete operations:

   *  Upload assets
   *  Insert assets into content
   *  Delete assets
   *  Create folders
   *  Delete folders. [GitHub-1487](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1487)

<!-- ENGCOM-8047 -->

*  Long Media Gallery text strings and folder names are no longer cropped. Previously, Magento displayed cropped text and images and displayed this message:  `We couldn't find any records`. [GitHub-1763 ](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1763), [GitHub-1758 ](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1758)

<!-- ENGCOM-8042 -->

*  Magento no longer displays the **Add Selected** button when no images are selected while editing content for a new page. [GitHub-1769](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1769)

<!-- ENGCOM-8047 -->

*  Filters are now applied as expected on the **Content**  >  **Media Gallery** Category grid. [GitHub-1763 ](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1763)

<!-- ENGCOM-8183 -->

*  Gallery multiply breakpoint options configuration now works as expected. Previously, breakpoint options configuration did not work properly because `mediaCheck` triggered the exit media query function on page load. [GitHub-29933](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29933)

### MFTF

<!-- ENGCOM-8359 -->

*  Replaced repetitive actions with action groups in `CheckStaticBlocksTest`. [GitHub-30561](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30561)

<!-- ENGCOM-8267 -->

*  `AdminUpdateCategoryAndMakeInactiveTest` and `VerifyChildCategoriesShouldNotIncludeInMenuTest` have been refactored to comply with MFTF best practices. [GitHub-30058](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30058)

<!-- ENGCOM-8458 -->

*  Removed duplicated `AdminOpenCMSBlocksGridActionGroup`. [GitHub-30896](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30896)

<!-- ENGCOM-8156 -->

*  Replaced `AdminOpentCmsBlockActionGroup` with AdminOpenCmsBlockActionGroup. [GitHub-29839](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29839)

<!-- ENGCOM-8226 -->

<!-- ENGCOM-8061 -->

*  Added action groups to the `Analytics` module. [GitHub-29500](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29500)

<!-- ENGCOM-7334 -->

*  Updated `CheckCheckoutSuccessPageAsRegisterCustomerTest` and `CheckCheckoutSuccessPageAsGuestTest` to cancel created orders after tests run. [GitHub-28324](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28324)

<!-- ENGCOM-8214 -->

*  Removed `AdminNavigateToPageGridActionGroup` due to redundancy. [GitHub-29838](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29838)

<!-- ENGCOM-8280 -->

*  An issue with `StorefrontProductListWidgetWithSharedCatalogTest` that caused the test to be skipped has been resolved. [GitHub-322](https://github.com/magento/partners-magento2b2b/issues/322)

<!-- ENGCOM-8122 -->

*  Implemented `ActionGroup` to navigate to the checkout page. [GitHub-29843](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29843)

<!-- ENGCOM-8124 -->

*  Implemented `AdminOpenCreateNewCMSPageActionGroup` to navigate to create new CMS page. [GitHub-29824](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29824)

<!-- ENGCOM-8268 -->

*  Corrected issues with skip in MFTF tests for CMS page for Media Gallery. [GitHub-30164](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30164)

<!-- B2B-831 -->

*  Meaningful titles and descriptions have been added to MFTF tests for the `Company`, `CompanyCredit`, `CompanyPayment`, `CompanyShipping`, and `ConfigurableSharedCatalog` modules. [GitHub-30164](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30164)

#### New tests

<!-- ENGCOM-7804 -->

*  Added a test for enabling email to a friend in the Admin. [GitHub-29145](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29145)

<!-- ENGCOM-8316 -->

*  Added a test for deleting a CMS block from a grid by an administrator. [GitHub-30372](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30372)

<!-- ENGCOM-7933 -->

*  Added a test for applying a shopping cart rule to a single bundle item. [GitHub-28921](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28921)

<!-- ENGCOM-8075 -->

*  Added tests to check whether **Used In** information for a Media Gallery image is displayed after the entity was deleted. [GitHub-1774](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1774)

### Newsletter

<!--- MC-38789-->

*  Admin users can now edit a customer account as expected when the customer is subscribed to a queued newsletter. [GitHub-30645](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30645)

<!-- ENGCOM-8034 -->

*  Magento now re-sends newsletter subscription confirmation if the shopper does not confirm their newsletter subscription. [GitHub-28422](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28422)

<!-- ENGCOM-8429 -->

*  You can now edit a customer account as expected when the customer is subscribed to a queued newsletter. [GitHub-30645](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30645)

### Payment methods

<!--- MC-35161-->

*  Payment methods are now loaded in the Admin for all websites as expected in a multi-store deployment.

<!--- MC-36954-->

*  Magento no longer displays the `Purchase Order number is a required field` message above the coupon code field before the shopper enters any information in deployments where Purchase Order has been configured as the only available payment option.

<!--- MC-35152-->

*  Magento now completes Payflow Pro payments successfully when the shopper’s name contains accented letters. Previously, payment did not complete, and Magento logged this error: `report.CRITICAL: String to be escaped was not valid UTF-8 or could not be converted`.

<!-- ENGCOM-8173 -->

*  Guest shoppers can now place PayPal orders when **Automatic Assignment to Customer Group** is enabled. The payment is processed on the PayPal gateway, the order is created in Magento, and the shopper sees the order thank-you page. Previously, the order was processed successfully on the PayPal gateway, but the order was not created in Magento. The shopper was instead re-directed to the order review page, where Magento displayed this error: `Failed address validation: %1" error`. [GitHub-25399](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25399)

#### PayPal

<!--- MC-35692-->

*  Merchants can now successfully place an order from the Admin after switching from a payment method that uses a credit card to a non-credit-card payment method. Previously, when a merchant clicked the **Submit Order** button, the loading process started but never completed, and the order was not placed.

<!--- MC-37649-->

*  Magento no longer creates duplicate orders when an order is placed with PayPal Express. Previously, when a shopper tried to pay for an order with PayPal Express but PayPal returned an error, Magento still created the order. This resulted in duplicate orders on the merchant’s site. [GitHub-13952](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13952)

<!--- MC-38829-->

*  PayPal Settlement reports are now available at **Reports** > **Sales** > **PayPal Settlement** as expected. Previously, Magento did not list these reports on the PayPal settlement report grid and displayed this message: `We couldn't find any records`.

<!--- MC-39442-->

*  Clicking the **PayPal** button during checkout no longer triggers a redundant `web-api` call. Previously, two requests were triggered, which doubled the charge for the product.

### Performance

<!--- MC-37705-->

*  Performance issues in `module-catalog-import-export/Model/Import/Product/Option.php` have been addressed. The time required to export or import more than 100,000 records has been reduced. See the [Import/Export takes longer than expected with large numbers of product options](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050695772) Knowledge Base article.

<!--- MC-37799-->

*  `Magento_Csp/Model/BlockCache` has been refactored to reduce both memory consumption and the generation of needlessly large cached strings. Previously, pages that included dynamically whitelisted scripts and styles often experienced from performance issues. [GitHub-29964](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29964)

<!-- MC-37816 -->

*  We have improved the performance of scheduled exports of catalogs that include more than 100,000 products using consumers.

<!-- MC-38306 -->

*  Magento no longer flushes category cache when you add or save a disabled product to a category. Previously, Magento flushed the cache for related categories despite the product status, which affected server performance.

<!-- MC-38518 -->

*  Page load time for updating product quantity in the shopping cart has improved. Previously, Magento executed multiple separate queries for each product in shopping cart, which increased page load time.

<!-- MC-39700 -->

*  An indexer has been added to the `Magento_Bulk` MySQL table, which has improved the performance of bulk operations.

<!-- MC-38593 -->

*  Magento now caches the children IDs of configurable products. This has improved page load performance by reducing the number of database requests. [GitHub-30585 ](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30585)

<!-- MC-37594 -->

*  Loading of the Admin dashboard has been improved. Previously, Magento displayed tab names as a list before the page completed loading.

<!-- MC-37417 -->

*  Redis cache management has been improved by the addition of expiry limits for layout caches. Previously, Redis caches reached allocated maximum memory quickly in large deployments, and Magento threw errors on write operations.

<!-- ENGCOM-8016 -->

*  Checkout performance has been improved by the removal of a redundant database query in `app/code/Magento/Catalog/Model/CategoryLink.php`. [GitHub-29453](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29453)

<!-- ENGCOM-8290 -->

*  `Magento\Framework\DB\Adapter\Pdo\Mysql->isTableExists` has been refactored to improve performance. Redundant calls to `SHOW TABLE STATUS` to check for the existence of a table have been reduced. [GitHub-29662](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29662)

<!-- ENGCOM-8258 -->

*  `getPageLayoutsConfig` is now saved in cache, which has improved config builder performance. [GitHub-29546](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29546)

<!--- MC-35614-->

*  Magento performance during edit and save operations for customer segments that contain more than 3,000,000 customers has improved.

### Persistent

<!-- MC-36647 -->

*  Shoppers can no longer place an order after their session cookie has expired when persistent cart is enabled. Instead, Magento displays the login page so that the shopper can log in. Previously, Magento placed the order. Magento did not properly validate the persistent customer when `PHPSESSID` had expired, and `customerSession` was re-created from the persistent information.

<!--- MC-39127-->

*  Magento now displays the Welcome message as expected after a shopper logs into a store where persistent shopping cart is enabled. Previously, Magento displayed the **Not you?** message after logging in.

<!--- MC-38269-->

*  Magento no longer displays the **Not you?** text when a customer selects the **Remember Me** option when logging in to a deployment where persistent shopping cart is enabled.

<!--- MC-37109-->

*  Magento no longer displays the contents of a customer’s cart after the customers session expires. Previously, Magento displayed this error when a guest customer tried to check out when persistent shopping cart was enabled: `No such entity with cartid = 0`.

### Pricing

<!--- MC-34394-->

*  Consecutive asynchronous price updates no longer interfere with each other, and the correct status is assigned to each operation. Previously, if an asynchronous price update failed, all following asynchronous price updates would fail until the corresponding queue consumer was restarted. [GitHub-27865](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27865)

### Reports

<!--- MC-36652 38925-->

*  **Reports** > **Marketing** > **Products in Carts** now displays only the record in the allowed scope of the user who is generating the report. Previously, all data was available for all scopes.

<!--- MC-38074-->

*  Magento now uses the currency specified in the role scope of the merchant generating the report when displaying product currency in the Products In Cart report.

<!--- MC-37934-->

*  The Recently Viewed and Recently Compared product features now display statistics for different stores and websites in the Admin as expected in a multi-store deployment. Previously, these features did not take into account all stores or websites.

<!--- MC-37217-->

*  Prices in Order reports now use the correct currency symbol.

<!-- ENGCOM-8314 -->

*  Magento now verifies the existence of a token when a user clicks the Admin dashboard **Go to Advanced Report** button.  If the token exists, Magento displays the Advanced Reporting page. If the token is not configured, Magento displays an informative page in the User Guide. [GitHub-25411](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25411)

### Return Merchandise Authorizations (RMA)

<!--- MC-36057-->

*  Selected options now apply to split line items when you split an RMA. Previously, values for Return Reason, Item Condition, and Resolution were not saved.

<!--- MC-35360-->

*  You can now delete tracking and shipping information for an RMA when JavaScript bundling is enabled.

<!--- MC-36757-->

*  Administrators with restricted access to only products in a specific website scope  can now add an item to a return even when that item is no longer in their website scope.

### Reviews

<!--- MC-37145-->

*  The number of ratings displayed on **Stores** > **Attribute** > **Rating** now matches the ratings count in a multi-site deployment. [GitHub-30258](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30258)

<!--- MC-37117-->

*  The New Review page now loads as expected when you click the **New Review** button on Admin **Marketing** > **All Reviews**. Clicking on a product on this page opens the expected new review form for that product.

<!-- ENGCOM-8383 -->

*  Magento no longer throws this error when you try to edit an order from Admin **Marketing**  >  **All Reviews**: `Uncaught TypeError: Event.observe is not a function`. [GitHub-30388](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30388)

### Rewards

<!--- MC-38257-->

*  Reward points are now calculated as expected for taxable orders when a partial order completes.

<!--- MC-37244-->

*  Merchants can now successfully issue a partial refund for an order that was purchased with reward points and still subsequently refund the order remainder. Previously, merchants could not refund the reward points for the order remainder.

<!--- MC-37113-->

*  Magento no longer displays this error when a shopper re-applies reward points after removing them: `You removed the reward points from this order`.

<!--- MC-37032-->

*  Reward points are now calculated correctly when a customer places an order using a non-base currency in a store that supports multiple currencies.

### Sales

<!--- MC-36219-->

*  The `order_created_at` column of the `sales_shipment_grid` is now updated as expected after each update.

<!--- MC-36405-->

*  You can now successfully re-order a product with a custom options date from a store for which **Use JavaScript Calendar** is enabled. Previously, when you tried to re-order, Magento did not add the item to the cart and displayed this error: `Could not add the product with SKU "simp1" to the shopping cart: Please specify date required option(s).`

<!--- MC-36533-->

*  Magento no longer immediately closes an order when a shopper checks out an order that consists of a virtual product with a total cost of $0 in deployments where the zero subtotal checkout method is enabled.

<!--- MC-36755-->

*  Magento no longer archives an order before processing it. Previously, multi-select action on the Admin order grid affected unselected orders.

<!--- MC-37371-->

*  The credit memo grid now displays the correct currency symbol when the Saudi Riyal (SAR) is set as the base currency.

<!--- MC-37880-->

*  Magento now consistently displays shipping address information as expected on the order page during checkout.

<!--- MC-38666-->

*  The value of `total_qty` now matches the value of `total_qty_ordered` in sales invoices.

<!--- MC-38717-->

*  Asynchronous sending of sales emails now sends email for only those orders that were created after the date of the last update. Previously, Magento did not filter emails by date when asynchronous sending was enabled.

<!--- MC-39135-->

*  Magento now sends invoice email as expected when an order is placed from the Admin.

<!--- MC-38917-->

*  Magento now clears existing order data during a session when a merchant creates a new order for a customer from the Admin.

<!--- MC-38915-->

*  You can now change the customer group for new customers that are created through an Admin order when **Enable Automatic Assignment to Customer Group** is enabled. You can also assign customer group based on VAT validation. Previously, when validating the VAT number, the request object did not check the assigned request `group_id`. By default, it used the default `group_id`.

<!--- MC-37539-->

*  Magento no longer changes the status of a custom order status with `Suspected Fraud` status to `Processing` after a merchant creates a partial shipment using the REST API.

### Sales Rule

<!--- MC-34793-->

*  Coupon codes that have been applied based on shipping method are no longer applied when a shopper changes shipping method. Previously, Magento did not clear coupon codes when shoppers switched shipping methods.

<!--- MC-34649-->

*  Shoppers cannot apply a coupon code more frequently than the **Uses Per Customer** setting permits. Previously, if a shopper had multiple browser windows open and placed multiple orders concurrently, each order received the discount, even though the **Uses Per Customer** setting had a value of **1**.

### Search

<!--- MC-35095-->

*  Elasticsearch no longer throws an unknown modifier error when a shopper searches on a search synonym. Previously, escaper lacked an escaping slash symbol in regular expressions, which resulted in a fatal error.

<!--- MC-37577-->

*  Advanced search no longer returns the children of configurable products as individual search results when the child products were configured with visibility set to **Not Visible Individually**.

<!--- MC-37954-->

*  The Elasticsearch sort of product names in search results is no longer case-sensitive.

<!-- ENGCOM-8329 -->

*  The search results page is now cached as expected when the **set Number of top search results to cache to 0** setting is enabled in Admin **Stores**  >  **Configuration**  >  **Catalog**  >  **Catalog**  > **Catalog Search**.

<!--- MC-36807-->

*  The catalog search indexer now executes without throwing an error due to the Elasticsearch field limit. Previously, Magento threw this error: `Limit of total fields [xxx] in index [m24dev_product_1_v10] has been exceeded`.

<!--- MC-35491-->

*  The performance of catalog search has improved. Disabling **Enable Search Suggestions** (**Stores** > **Configuration** > **Catalog** > **Catalog Search** ) works as expected. Previously, Magento queried the MySQL `search_query` table instead of Elasticsearch for autocomplete search suggestions. [GitHub-25534](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25534)

<!--- MC-35256-->

*  Elasticsearch now filters product prices the same as MySQL. The field type `price_*`  was changed from `float` to `double` in the Elasticsearch index to improve precision and correct a floating-point error.

<!-- ENGCOM-8393 -->

*  A keydown event listener has been added to the Admin to activate the global search form when a forward slash is entered. [GitHub-29551](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29551)

<!--- MC-24217-->

*  Elasticsearch no longer throws an error but instead displays no products as expected when a `string` value is used to filter products by attribute with an `integer` or `decimal` backend type. Previously, Magento displayed this error in `exception.log`: `number format exception`.

<!-- ENGCOM-8303 -->

*  Elasticsearch no longer throws an exception when a search term contains a  `/`.  [GitHub-25886](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25886), [GitHub-25110](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25110)

*  Search is now disabled as expected for a selected customer group from the products query when the **Disallow Catalog Search By** configuration setting in the general Category Permissions is enabled. [GitHub-29927](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29927)

<!-- ENGCOM-8466 -->

*  Search results no longer include multiple quotations of the same word. [GitHub-30104](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30104)

### Shipping

<!--- MC-38247 -->

*  The checkout process no longer fails when a network interruption disrupts the connection to the DHL shipping method. Instead, Magento displays other available shipping methods. Previously, the checkout process stalled when the connection to DHL shipping was interrupted, and Magento displayed this error: `Sorry, no quotes are available for this order at this time`. [GitHub-29902](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29902)

<!--- MC-35194-->

*  The fields that describe the UPS delivery method on Admin **Stores** >  **Configuration** > **Sales** > **Delivery Methods** are now enabled as expected.

<!--- MC-35633-->

*  Shipments created through the POST `/rest/V1/shipment` endpoint now update orders properly. Previously, Magento created a shipment, but shipment status remained in the processing state.

<!--- MC-37120-->

*  Magento no longer removes simple products from the shopping cart when another product is removed from the cart before checkout with Ship to Multiple Addresses. [GitHub-30259](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30259)

<!--- MC-38031-->

*  The Order Review page now displays the tax amount before shipping amount as expected for orders being shipped to multiple addresses.

<!-- ENGCOM-8257 -->

*  UPS shipment tracking now indicates a status of `Delivered On` only when a package has been delivered. [GitHub-30032](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30032)

<!--- MC-38825-->

*  Magento now displays the correct cart subtotal for orders that contain a virtual product when the shopper navigates back to their cart from checking out with multiple addresses.

<!--- MC-38682-->

*  Merchants can now create a shipping label from the shipping page for an existing order that uses FedEx shipping when JavaScript bundling is enabled. Previously, Magento threw an error when the merchant clicked the **Create Shipping Label** button.

<!--- MC-36953-->

*  The shipment tracking link in the shipment confirmation email sent to customers now works as expected. Previously, this link returned a 404 error.

<!-- ENGCOM-8025 -->

*  Magento now displays an informative error message when a shopper checks out using multiple addresses, then removes all products other than a virtual product. [GitHub-25595](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25595)

<!-- ENGCOM-8253 -->

*  You can now create a shipping label as expected for a partial order. Previously, when you tried to create a shipping label for only one item from an order, Magento added all products to the package, and validation failed. [GitHub-29552](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29552)

<!-- ENGCOM-8154 -->

*  Validation for the shipping method is no longer bypassed when calling `/V1/guest-carts/:cartId/totals-information`. [GitHub-25147](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25147)

### Sitemap

<!--- MC-37306-->

*  Sitemaps that are generated by `cron` now include correct image URLs. Previously, the generated cached image path was incorrect in multi-store deployments.

### Staging

<!--- MC-39046 -->

*  The Edit Home Page page now displays all scheduled updates as expected when you check for home page scheduled updates. Previously, Magento displayed only one of several scheduled updates.

<!--- MC-34988 -->

*  Sending 0 with the `/rest/V1/products/special-price-information` special price endpoint now saves the price and returns the schedule as expected.

<!--- MC-35362 -->

*  Scheduled imports now run as expected when the import CSV file contains a byte order mark (BOM).

<!--- MC-38026 -->

*  Magento no longer removes the layout body class when a merchant schedules a category update.

<!--- MC-38234 -->

*  Rescheduled product changes are now no longer erased after a `cron` run.

<!--- MC-38759-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when you try to schedule an update for a category. Previously, Magento threw this error when you clicked **Save** on the Schedule New Update page: `Something went wrong while saving the Magento\Catalog\Api\Data\CategoryInterface`.

<!--- MC-38455-->

*  The `rest/V1/products/special-price` API can now be used to schedule product special prices for multiple stores. Previously, Magento threw an error when a merchant scheduled a price update for multiple stores for same `from` and `to` time when a roll back is available at the new schedule’s start time.

### Store

<!-- ENGCOM-7543 -->

*  The Admin and main store switcher now reflect changes made to the store sort order in the Admin. [GitHub-13401](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13401)

<!-- ENGCOM-8274 -->

*  Magento now creates correct URLs for categories and products after a store view’s top-level URL key is changed. Previously, when a store view’s category tree contained modified  `url_keys`, if a category key did not change but the category parents’ key did, then the original code would used the category’s default store view when creating URLs. [GitHub-28633](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28633)

### Target rules

<!--- MC-34998-->

*  Loading of product details pages has been optimized. We have added indices for database tables that optimize target rule conditions queries for many cases.

<!--- MC-36288-->

*  Target rules for related products now work when the `is one of` condition that is used for the Products to Display feature contains multiple conditions. Previously, when this condition contained multiple values, it was not parsed.

### Tax

<!--- MC-37666-->

*  VAT validation on a guest order no longer results in Magento saving the quote with an incorrect Customer Tax Class. [GitHub-30018](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30018)

<!--- MC-37761-->

*  Orders being shipped to multiple addresses can now be saved during checkout when FPT is configured. Previously, after completing an order for multiple addresses, Magento displayed a blank page instead of the order success page.

<!-- ENGCOM-8158 -->

*  Storefront product detail pages now display old and new prices with and without tax as expected. [GitHub-27500](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27500), [GitHub-11998](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11998)

### Test

<!--- MC-37364-->

*  `bin/magento dev:tests:run` now launches the following tests as expected: all, unit, integration, integration-all, static, static-all, integrity, legacy, and default.

<!--- MC-38488-->

*  `AdminMediaGalleryInsertLargeImageFileSizeTest` has been refactored.

<!-- ENGCOM-8158 -->

*  Unit tests are now compatible with PHPUnit 8. [GitHub-29779](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29779)

<!-- ENGCOM-8009 -->

*  `\Magento\TestFramework\TestCase\WebapiAbstract` now contains a function that supports comparing large nested arrays of expected and actual outcomes in tests. Irrelevant keys in the outcome can now be ignored. [GitHub-29498](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29498)

<!-- ENGCOM-8024 -->

*  `AdminMediaGalleryCatalogUiEditCategoryGridPageTest` no longer fails randomly. [GitHub-1764](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1764)

<!-- ENGCOM-8041 -->

*  `dev/tests/integration/testsuite/Magento/Customer/Controller/AccountTest` has been improved. (`assert` is now based on `XPath` selector instead of `assertStringContainsString`.) [GitHub-29700](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29700)

<!-- ENGCOM-8017 -->

*  Added test coverage for the `AdminAnalytics` module. [GitHub-29500](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29500)

<!-- ENGCOM-8266 -->

*  Integration and API functional tests are now compatible with PHPUnit 9.3. [GitHub-30146](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30146)

<!--- MC-35798 8109-->

*  Corrected issues with the GraphQL `testRequestCacheTagsForCategoryListOnMultipleIds` test. [GitHub-29372](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29372)

<!-- ENGCOM-8327 -->

*  The currency availability test for Company credit has been automated.

<!-- ENGCOM-7762 -->

*  Header values that include URLs are now parsed properly in `ApiFunctional TestFramewor`k. [GitHub-26425](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26425)

<!-- ENGCOM-8382 -->

*  `—no-tablespaces` has been added to all occurrences of `mysqldump`, which permits integration tests to run without the `PROCESS` privilege (required since MySQL 5.7.31 / 8.0.21 to run `mysqldump` by default). [GitHub-30566](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30566)

### Theme

<!-- ENGCOM-8419 -->

*  A new `--no-parent` flag was added to the `bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy` command that prevents the parent(s) of a theme from being compiled. This new flag you can significantly improve the performance of the static content deployment process by avoiding  unnecessary compilation. Note that this new flag does not work when using the `compact` strategy. [GitHub-30184](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30184)

<!--- MC-37630 -->

*  Design configuration no longer generates DDL operations. Previously, when the design configuration was updated, Magento generated DDL statements that could trigger MySQL errors.

<!-- ENGCOM-8112 -->

*  Redundant code in the `Magento_ConfigurableProduct` module in the Admin theme has been removed.  [GitHub-29857](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29857)

<!-- ENGCOM-8144 -->

*  Redundant less styles navigation and unused properties in the Blank theme have been removed. [GitHub-29914](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29914)

<!-- ENGCOM-8285 -->

*  Added collapsible navigation functionality to the Blank theme in mobile view. [GitHub-30237](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30237)

<!-- ENGCOM-7803 -->

*  Web font loading for themes has been optimized.  [GitHub-29526](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29526)

<!-- ENGCOM-8068 -->

*  Developers can now specify font type when declaring a custom font in a theme. [GitHub-29719](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29719)

### Translation and locales

<!--- MC-36836 -->

*  The Admin Orders grid Date Picker now works as expected when the Admin locale is Arabic (`ar_SA - Saudi Arabia`).

<!--- MC-38476 -->

*  Magento no longer displays an error message when a shopper enters an Argentinian address with a valid post code when registering or adding a new address. Previously, Magento displayed this error: `Provided Zip/Postal Code seems to be invalid. Example: 1234. If you believe it is the right one you can ignore this notice.`

<!--- MC-38663-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when a shopper enters a five-digit postal code for a Korean address.

<!-- ENGCOM-8244 -->

*  Added support for the Uruguay regions that are defined in [ISO 3166-2:UY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:UY). [GitHub-29729](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29729)

<!-- ENGCOM-8220 -->

*  `zip_codes.xml` has been updated to enforce eight-digits for Brazilian zip codes. [GitHub-29984](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29984)

<!-- ENGCOM-8304 -->

*  Improved localization of remaining unlocalized phrases. [GitHub-11175](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11175)

<!-- ENGCOM-8380 -->

*  The grid search input placeholder can now be translated. [GitHub-30510](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30510)

<!-- ENGCOM-8018 -->

*  Magento now downloads inline translations JavaScript modules only when they are enabled.  [GitHub-29553](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29553)

### UI

<!--- MC-38509-->

*  The **Create an Account** button on the Create New Account page remains active when a shopper enters invalid data. Previously, this button was disabled, which prevented shoppers from re-attempting to create an account after making an error. This was a known issue in Magento 2.4.1. [GitHub-30513](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30513)

<!--- MC-38698-->

*  Loading of the shipping grid on the Admin Order Edit page has been improved.

<!--- MC-37870-->

*  Magento now displays the  **Same As Billing Address** check box as expected on the order page when products have been added to the cart by SKU.

<!-- ENGCOM-8007 -->

*  The CSS class that defined limited width is now applied as expected to the **Start Time** fields on Admin **Store**  >  **Configuration**  >  **Catalog**  >  **XML Sitemap**  >  **Generation Settings**.  [GitHub-29496](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29496)

<!-- ENGCOM-7992 -->

*  Corrected display issues with the Terms and Conditions checkbox label.  [GitHub-24060](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24060)

<!-- ENGCOM-7948 -->

*  Magento no longer displays the CSS code for a tier price block on the product page when the tier prices are not available. [GitHub-29194](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29194)

<!-- ENGCOM-8084 -->

*  The position of the buttons on the image view details page have been re-ordered to conform with user interface guidelines.  [GitHub-1783](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1783)

<!-- ENGCOM-8342 -->

*  Coupon code text field is now displayed in proper width in Internet Explorer/EDGE browsers.

<!-- ENGCOM-7630 -->

*  The `@button__border-radius` variable is now defined in the `lib/web/css/source/lib/variables/_buttons.less` library.  `border-radius` has a default value of `3px`. Previously, `border-radius` was hard-coded.  [GitHub-28674](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28674)

<!-- ENGCOM-8067 -->

*  The submit search button (magnifying glass) in the mini search field is now disabled until the minimum search string length has been reached. [GitHub-29704](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29704)

<!--- MC-38807-->

*  The **Preview Template** button now works as expected in the Edit Queue page.

<!--- MC-35624-->

*  Adjusted the position of the cursor from the middle to the beginning of the **Message** field on **My Account** > **Gift Registry** > **Share Gift Registry**.

<!--- MC-33497-->

*  Display issues with the column layout on the Add Scheduled Export page have been resolved.

<!--- MC-31892-->

*  Magento now preserves an attribute’s value when you move the attribute from one group to another.

<!--- MC-37635-->

*  Magento now displays a calendar icon next to the **Date** input field as expected on the storefront Create an account page.

<!-- ENGCOM-8085 -->

*  Added a font weight heavy variable to `lib/web/css/source/lib/variables/_typography.less`. [GitHub-29778](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29778)

<!-- ENGCOM-8211 -->

*  Filter visibility now works with column visibility as expected in Admin grids.  [GitHub-30345](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30345)

<!-- ENGCOM-7977 -->

*  The banner that Magento displays on the Admin Login as Customer page now remains at the top of the page when the user scrolls. [GitHub-29354](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29354)

<!-- ENGCOM-8152 -->

*  UI select component options are no longer visible when `this.disabled(true)` is set. [GitHub-29098](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29098)

<!-- ENGCOM-7901 -->

*  The `@font-family-name__base` variable  is no longer used when loading the Open Sans font. [GitHub-29515](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29515)

<!-- ENGCOM-8120 -->

*  The WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-atomic="true”` has been added to the error container tag. [GitHub-29560](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29560)

<!-- ENGCOM-8175 -->

*  UI Component grids now display an accurate count of selected items. Previously, grids indicated a wrong number of selections when a search by keyword selected all grid items and the shopper subsequently deselected some items before selecting the header checkbox. [GitHub-29968](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29968)

<!-- ENGCOM-8118 -->

*  Magento no longer displays unrendered HTML on invoice and shipment overview pages. [GitHub-29958](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29958)

<!-- ENGCOM-8066 -->

*  Clicking **Options** on the Admin **Stores**  >  **Currency Rates**  now directs users to the expanded currency options section of the System configuration page. [GitHub-29336](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29336)

<!-- ENGCOM-8361 -->

*  Improved support for displaying a widget depending on another condition for Magento `adminhtml` widgets when using a chooser widget type. [GitHub-13316](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13316), [GitHub-7252](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/7252), [GitHub-6868](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/6868)

<!-- ENGCOM-8336 -->

*  Improved padding of text in confirmation pop-up dialogs in Luma theme. [GitHub-30452](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30452)

### Vault

<!--- MC-39109-->

*  The `Vault` module now recognizes payment method codes from the request for the payment information management service. Previously, when a shopper placed an order using a saved Braintree credit card, Magento threw this error even when a valid payment method was used: `The requested Payment Method is not available`.

### Vertex

*  Address suggestions are now removed as expected when an address is modified.

*  A race condition that prevented some customers from saving their address in their account panel has been resolved.

*  Vertex address validation no longer adds the Address Edit page to the full-page cache in certain conditions.

*  Vertex-calculated tax is now considered when free shipping is configured for an amount inclusive of tax.

### Web API framework

<!--- MC-23904 ENGCOM-8421-->

*  You can now use POST `V1/invoice/:invoiceId/refund` to refund an invoice that has a zero quantity of products and zero shipping charges (for example, `{“items": [{"qty": 0, "orderItemId": 6, "extensionAttributes": {}}], "appendComment": false, "notify": true, "isOnline": true, "arguments": {"adjustment_negative": 0.0, "adjustment_positive": 0.99, "shipping_amount": 0}}.` ) Previously, Magento threw this error: `You can't create a creditmemo without products`. [GitHub-23069](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23069)

<!--- MC-33732 -->

*  You can now use POST `V1/categories` to create or update a category. Previously, Magento did not save the value if the `default_sort_by` value was set as an array. When the `default_sort_by` value was set as a string, Magento threw this error: `Error occurred during \"custom_attributes\" processing. Attribute \"default_sort_by\" has invalid value. The \"string\" value's type is invalid. The \"string[]\" type was expected. Verify and try again.`

<!--- MC-35740 -->

*  Using POST `V1/invoices/:id/capture` to capture payment information now works as expected. Previously, Magento authorized the order but captured it only on the payment gateway's site.

<!--- MC-37794 -->

*  When you use POST `V1/order/:orderId/ship` to create a partial shipment, the endpoint returns the correct number of shipped products.

<!--- MC-38425-->

*  Invoices created using POST `V1/order/:orderID/invoice` now accurately reflect partial payment by store credit. Previously, when an order was partially paid for with store credit, the invoice was created without taking the store credit into account.

<!--- MC-36830-->

*  The GET `rest/all/V1/categories` and GET `rest/all/V1/categories?rootCategoryId=2` calls now return populated `name` and `product_count` fields as expected for all categories in the tree. Previously, the category field values were empty. The table name resolver plug-in returned an incorrect table name for fetching the count of products by category.

<!-- ENGCOM-8286 -->

*  The PUT `V1/categories/:id` endpoint now stores the data needed to create 301 redirects for category URL keys  when the `save_rewrites_history` custom attribute is provided. [GitHub-29174](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29174), [GitHub-30240](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30240)

### Wishlist

<!--- MC-33626-->

*  Shoppers can now add a product to a wishlist when the product is assigned to a custom inventory source. [GitHub-3018](https://github.com/magento/inventory/issues/3018)

<!--- MC-35416-->

*  Administrators can now access the Manage Shopping Cart page from the Admin customer page after a customer has added a product to their wishlist from the storefront. Previously, Magento displayed the following error when the administrator clicked the **Manage Shopping Cart** button: `An error has occurred. See error log for details`.

<!--- MC-35573-->

*  The **Add to cart** button on the shared wishlist page now works as expected for anonymous, guest, and users who are not logged in.

<!--- MC-34411-->

*  Shoppers can now successfully move a product from one wishlist to another.

<!-- ENGCOM-8062 -->

*  Magento now displays selected configurable product attribute options in the wishlist page as expected. [GitHub-24091](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24091),  [GitHub-22503](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22503)

<!-- ENGCOM-7779 -->

*  Implemented `ActionInterface` for `\Magento\Wishlist\Controller\Shared\Allcart`. [GitHub-29537](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29537)

## Known issues

**Issue**: Merchants must activate the Fastly Force TLS functionality from the Admin to enable the global HTTP to HTTPS redirect for all store pages. See the [Redirect HTTP to HTTPS for all pages on Cloud (Force TLS)](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006296953) Knowledge Base article. <!--- MC-39988-->

**Issue**: You cannot use the `addConfigurableProductToCart` GraphQL mutation to add a configurable product to a cart in a non-default store view in a multi-store deployment that runs Inventory. (Luma storefronts are not affected.) Magento displays this error: `Could not add item to cart. Please check required options and try again`. **Workaround**: Use the `addProductsToCart` mutation instead. [GitHub-31660](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/31660)<!--- PWA-1298-->

**Issue**: Magento does not submit payment information as expected when a shopper first enters a correct code into the CAPTCHA field on the Payment page but displays this error: `There has been an error processing your request`. This occurs only when the shopper tries to place the order either without entering the CAPTCHA code or by entering it incorrectly.  **Workaround**:  Refresh the page. <!--- MC-40506-->

**Issue**: Magento creates an order in Braintree as expected when a shopper clicks **Pay with Venmo**, but does not create the order in the Admin. **Workaround**: None. See the [Magento 2.4.2 known issue: Braintree Venmo payment does not work](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360054662652/)  Knowledge Base article.  <!--- BUNDLE-2894-->

### B2B known issues

**Issue**: B2B buyers can use online payment methods to bypass the usual purchase order flow. This scenario can occur if the buyer can reduce their entire checkout total to a 0 — for example, by a promo code or gift card —  and subsequently remove the code or gift card. Even under those conditions, Magento still places the order for the correct amount based on the prices of the items in their assigned catalog. **Workaround**: Disable gift cards and coupon codes when online payment methods are enabled for purchase order approval. <!--- B2B-1603-->

**Issue**: Buyers are redirected to the shopping cart when trying to place an order from a purchase order using PayPal Express Checkout when **In-Context Mode** is disabled. <!--- B2B-1604-->

**Issue**: Magento sometimes displays a 404 error when a buyer creates a purchase order and then navigates to the checkout page. This error occurs when a buyer has previously created a different purchase order with an online payment method before navigating to the checkout page without completing the previous purchase. The buyer can still place the purchase order. **Workaround**: None. <!--- B2B-1605-->

**Issue**: Discounts for a specific payment method persist during checkout for a purchase order even when the buyer changes their payment method during final checkout. As a result, customers may receive a discount that they are not entitled to. This occurs because a cart rule for the original payment method is still applied despite the change in payment method. **Workaround**: None. See the [Magento 2.4.2 B2B known issue: discount remains for online Purchase Orders after payment method is changed](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360054667312) Knowledge Base article. <!-- B2B-1012 -->

**Issue**: The `deleteRequisitionListOutput` query returns details about the deleted requisition list instead of the remaining requisition lists. <!--- MC-39894-->
