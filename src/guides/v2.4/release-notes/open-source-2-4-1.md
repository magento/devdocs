title: Magento Open Source 2.4.1 Release Notes
---

Magento Open Source 2.4.1 introduces enhancements to performance and security. Security enhancements include support for the `SameSite` attribute for cookies and the addition of CAPTCHA protection for payment-related and order-related API endpoints and the Place Order storefront page.

This release includes all improvements to core quality that were included in Magento 2.4.0, over 150 new fixes to core code, and over 15 security enhancements. It includes the resolution of almost 300 GitHub issues by our community members. These community contributions range from minor clean-up of core code to significant enhancements in GraphQL.

All known issues identified in Magento 2.4.0 have been fixed in this release.

Quarterly releases may contain backward-incompatible changes (BIC). Magento 2.4.1 contains minor backward-incompatible changes. To review minor backward-incompatible changes, see [BIC reference]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/reference.html). (Major backward-incompatible issues are described in [BIC highlights]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/index.html). Not all releases introduce major BICs.)

## Security-only patch available

Merchants can now install time-sensitive security fixes without applying the hundreds of functional fixes and enhancements that a full quarterly release (for example, Magento 2.4.0-p1) provides. Patch 2.4.0.1 (Composer package 2.4.0-p1) is a security-only patch that provides fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in our previous quarterly release, Magento 2.4.0. All hot fixes that were applied to the 2.4.0 release are included in this security-only patch. (A *hot fix* provides a fix to a released version of Magento that addresses a specific problem or bug.)

For general information about security-only patches, see the Magento DevBlog post [Introducing the New Security-only Patch Release](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Introducing-the-New-Security-only-Patch-Release/ba-p/141287). For instructions on downloading and applying security-only patches (including patch 2.3.5-p2), see [Install Magento using Composer]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/composer.html). Security-only patches include security bug fixes only, not the additional security enhancements that are included in the full patch.

## Other release information

Although code for these features is bundled with quarterly releases of the Magento core code, several of these projects (for example, Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Studio) are also released independently. Bug fixes for these projects are documented in the separate, project-specific release information that is available in the documentation for each project.

## Highlights

Look for the following highlights in this release.

### Substantial security enhancements

This release includes over 15 security fixes and platform security improvements. All security fixes have been backported to Magento 2.4.0-p1 and Magento 2.3.6.

#### Over 15 security enhancements that help close remote code execution (RCE) and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities

No confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. Most of these issues require that an attacker first obtains access to the Admin. As a result, we remind you to take all necessary steps to protect your Admin, including but not limited to these efforts: IP allowlisting, [two-factor authentication]({{page.baseurl}}/security/two-factor-authentication.html), use of a VPN, the use of a unique location rather than `/admin`, and good password hygiene. See _Security Updates Available for Magento_ for a discussion of these fixed issues.

#### Additional security enhancements

Security improvements for this release include:

*  **CAPTCHA** protection has been added to the following product areas:

   *  Place Order storefront page and REST and GraphQL endpoints <!--- MC-36067-->
   *  Payment-related REST and GraphQL endpoints.<!--- MC-36064-->

   CAPTCHA protection for these additional pages is disabled by default. It can be enabled on the Admin in the same way that other pages covered by CAPTCHA are. This protection has been added as an anti-brute force mechanism to protect stores against carding attacks.

*  **Support for the SameSite attribute for cookies**. To support the Google Chrome enforcement of the new cookie classification system, Magento classes that handle cookies have been updated to support the `SameSite` cookie attribute. This attribute is set to `Lax` by default but can be explicitly overridden. <!--- MC-35389-->

*  **Enhanced Magento Scan Tool**. Adobe has partnered with [Sanguine Security](https://sansec.io/), a leader in preventing digital skimming, to integrate their database of over 8700 threat signatures into the Magento Security Scan Tool. This partnership will enable merchants to get real-time insights into the security status of their site through proactive detection of malware and reduction of false positives. Merchants can register for the tool by visiting https://account.magento.com/scanner. For more information, see the [Secure Your Storefront With the Enhanced Magento Security Scan Tool](https://magento.com/blog/magento-news/secure-your-storefront-enhanced-magento-security-scan-tool) blog post.

{:.bs-callout-info}
Starting with the release of Magento Commerce 2.3.2, Magento will assign and publish indexed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers with each security bug reported to us by external parties. This allows users of Magento Commerce to more easily identify unaddressed vulnerabilities in their deployment. You can learn more about CVE identifiers at [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/).

### Infrastructure improvements

This release contains enhancements to core quality, which improve the quality of the Framework and these functional areas: Customer Account, Catalog, CMS, OMS, Import/Export, Promotions and Targeting, Cart and Checkout, and Staging and Preview.

*  Merchants can now allow users to clear the contents of their shopping cart in a single action and can configure this ability independently on each website <!--- BUNDLE-108 -->

### Performance improvements

*  **Reduction in the size of network transfers between Redis and Magento**. Plugin list configuration is now generated during the execution of the `bin/magento di:compile` command. This configuration information is written to generated metadata folders based on scope. Previously, this information was stored in cache. Resulting performance improvements include a decrease in network cache size and execution time for many scenarios.<!--- MC-31617-->

*  **Enhanced message queue consumer performance**. Three new configuration settings support a decrease of 20% in consumer queue CPU consumption. These optional parameters provide increased control over consumers and save server resources.

*  **Improved execution time** for `bin/magento` commands.

### Adobe Stock Integration

This release includes Adobe Stock Integration v2.1.0.

### New Media Gallery

The New Media Gallery is now enabled by default in the Admin. Merchants can now perform these actions on images in the Media Gallery:

*  Delete images in bulk
*  Optimize media storage by identifying duplicate images and images that are not used on the storefront
*  Filter images by the storefront area they are used in, including product and category content and CMS blocks
*  Work with image metadata
   *  View metadata from the images uploaded into Media Gallery
   *  Edit image metadata (title, description, and keywords)
   *  Search for images by their metadata

### GraphQL

This release adds GraphQL coverage for the following features:

*  **Product reviews**. Customers and guests can write product reviews. Customers can retrieve their product review histories.<!--- MC-32349-->

*  **Gift options**. All customers and guests can add a gift message to their order. On {{site.data.var.ee}}  installations, they can also add gift wrapping, gift receipts, and printed cards to the order.<!--- MC-32345-->

*  **Reward points**. On {{site.data.var.ee}} installations, customers can apply or remove reward points to their carts. They can also view their reward point history.<!--- MC-23366-->

*  **Order history**. All customers can view details about their order histories, including invoices, shipping, and refunds.<!--- MC-20635-->

*  **Add to cart**. Customers can add the following product types to their cart:  Simple, Configurable, Bundled, Grouped, Virtual, Gift Card, and Downloadable. <!--- MC-21513-->

*  **Stored payment methods**. Logged-in customers can now store payment details (including Braintree credit card and Braintree with PayPal) in MyAccount. <!--- MC-32348 35945 35946-->

See the [GraphQL Developer Guide]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/) for details on this and other enhancements.

### PWA Studio

PWA Studio v8.0.0 introduces new features and enhancements:

*  Updates to the Venia style guide that apply to design tokens, typography, colors, core components, and page layouts. <!--- PWA-519 419-->

*  Improvements to the Venia mini-cart experience <!--- PWA-236-->

*  Initial support for multiple locales and localized content on the Venia storefront <!--- PWA-295-->

*  Numerous improvements to the MyAccount experience of the Venia storefront <!--- PWA-247-->

See [Magento compatibility](https://magento.github.io/pwa-studio/technologies/magento-compatibility/) for a list of PWA Studio versions and their compatible Magento core versions. For information about enhancements and bug fixes, see [PWA Studio releases](https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio/releases).

### Magento Functional Testing Framework (MFTF)

MFTF 3.1.0 is now available. See [Magento Functional Testing Framework Changelog](https://github.com/magento/magento2-functional-testing-framework/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md).

## Fixed issues

We have fixed hundreds of issues in the Magento 2.4.1 core code.

### Installation, upgrade, deployment

<!--- MC-36113-->

*  Installation of Magento with third-party extensions that have dependencies on APIs for the Store module in CLI commands no longer fails. Previously, Magento displayed this error message: `The default website isn't defined. Set the website and try again`. This was a known issue in Magento 2.4.0.

<!--- MC-33273-->

*  `bin/magento setup:di:compile` no longer throws a fatal error. Previously, Magento threw an error the first time you ran this command, but the second execution resulted in successful compilation.

<!--- MC-34429-->

*  Upgrade no longer fails when a plugin is declared on `Magento\Framework\Encryption\Encryptor`.

<!--- MC-36231-->

*  Magento now displays an informative error message when some themes are not deployed after running `bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy`. Previously, when deployment completed successfully but not all packages were deployed, Magento did not display an error. When the command is executed with enabled parallel processing and each theme requires more time to be deployed then the specified maximum execution time, this command can finish successfully, although themes are not deployed.

<!--- MC-35001-->

*  The **Use default** checkbox for Klarna payments (**Stores** > **Configuration** > **Sales** > **Payment methods** > **Klarna**) now remain checked as expected when website scope changes.

<!--- MC-33788-->

*  Upgrade no longer results in the sudden failure of the Galera cluster. Previously, the Galera cluster exited abruptly after re-indexing immediately after upgrade. During Magento upgrade, index tables are altered, and the engine is changed from `MEMORY` to `InnoDB`. At this point, the content of these tables became out-of-sync between the nodes of the Galera cluster. [GitHub-25334](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25334)

<!--- MC-34254-->

*  Disabling the PageBuilder module no longer affects the rendering of the product page.  Previously, custom layouts on the product page disappeared when the module was disabled, and Magento displayed a blank page.

<!--- ENGCOM-7219-->

*  You can now use `bin/magento sampledata:deploy` to deploy sample data as expected after installing Magento using Composer. Previously, Magento threw this error: `Git installations must deploy sample data from GitHub; see https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/install/sample-data-after-clone.html for more information`. _Fix submitted by Andrii Beziazychnyi in pull request [27481](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27481)_. [GitHub-19481](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19481)

<!--- ENGCOM-7459-->

<!--- MC-17959 ENGCOM-7629-->

*  Running `bin/magento config:show <vendor_module>/general/value` now returns `0` or an empty string as expected. Previously, it returned `Configuration for path: "vendor_module/general/value" doesn't exist`. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [28549](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28549)._ [GitHub-23290](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23290)

<!--- ENGCOM-7853-->

*  `bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy --language=all` now deploys all languages that are used on the storefront and all languages configured by Admin users when no language parameter is set. (`en_US` is always deployed by default.) _Fix submitted by Anton Evers in pull request [28922](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28922)_. [GitHub-29218](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29218)

[GitHub-1750](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1750)

<!--- ENGCOM-7987-->

*  Catalog image helper initialization now uses the product model instead of `DataObject`.  _Fix submitted by jmonteros422 in pull request [29435](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29435)_. [GitHub-1711](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1711)

<!--- MC-37226-->

*  Admin users can now save an empty **Customer Token Lifetime (hours)** field (Admin **Stores**  >  **Configurations**  >  **Services**  >  **OAuth**  >  **Access Token Expiration**). [GitHub-29502](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29502)

### Adobe Stock

<!--- ENGCOM-7776-->

*  Images in the Adobe Stock images grid are now properly aligned after filters have been cleared. _Fix submitted by Nazar Klovanych in pull request [28366](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28366)_. [GitHub-824](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/824), [GitHub-972](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/972)

[GitHub-23440](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23440)

### Cache

<!--- MC-36096-->

*  Local cache storage is now retained for the period of time set in **Stores** > **Configuration** > **General** > **Web** > **Default Cookie Settings**. Previously, the expiry date of cookies was hard-coded to one day, which put it out of sync with this setting. As a result, welcome messages did not retain returning customer information for the expected duration.

<!--- ENGCOM-7780-->

*  The number of calls to page cache `config` has been reduced. _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [28992](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28992)_. [GitHub-29159](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29159)

[GitHub-1694](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1694)

<!--- ENGCOM-8019-->

*  Magento now adds tags correctly when you edit multiple images successively in the Media Gallery. _Fix submitted by Nazar Klovanych in pull request [29429](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29429)_. [GitHub-1755](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1755

<!--- MC-29069-->

*  Direct SQL queries have been replaced by Data Provider, which has improved checkout performance. _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [29376](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29376)_. [GitHub-29453](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29453)

<!--- MC-36252-->

*  The Products in the Comparison and the Recently Compared Products lists now work as expected. Previously, when the comparison list was expanded, Magento did not display products, even though the section indicated that the list contained products.

<!--- MC-35329-->

*  The **Delete** button on the **Add to Shopping Cart by SKU** section of a customer’s **Manage Shopping Cart** page now works as expected when multiple rows are selected.

<!--- MC-34999-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when you try to order a product by SKU when the digits you enter match a valid SKU but the case of these digits differ. Previously, when you entered an SKU on **My Account** > **Order by SKU** that did not exactly match a valid SKU, Magento threw an error.

<!--- MC-25042-->

*  A customer’s shipping address is now selected by default at checkout when the address is located in the country identified on the Allow Countries list and that list includes only that country. Previously, Magento did not select the address as default and displayed this error message: `Please specify a regionId in shipping address`.

<!--- MC-24043-->

*  Merchants can now enable **Apply to Shipping Amount** in the Action tab of **Marketing** > **Cart Price Rules** > **Add New Rule** when **Fixed amount discount for whole cart** is applied. [GitHub-24422](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24422)

<!--- MC-23992-->

*  Magento no longer throws an exception when a shopper tries to  unset the persistence cookie after beginning checkout and then navigating to the storefront home page. Previously, when the shopper clicked the **Not you?** link on the home page, Magento threw this exception: `The shipping address is missing. Set the address and try again`.  [GitHub-24218](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24218)

<!--- MC-33899-->

*  Magento now displays an add-to-cart success message when a customer adds an out-of-stock product to their cart. Previously, the product was added, but Magento did not display a success message.

<!--- ENGCOM-7746-->

*  Discounts are now applied as expected to shipping charges when **Apply to Shipping Amount** is enabled.  _Fix submitted by Andrii Kalinich in pull request [28839](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28839)_. [GitHub-26723](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26723)

<!--- ENGCOM-7752-->

*  The code that supports closing the mini cart has been refactored to remove the `closeSidebar` function. The appropriate click binding has been added to the `[data-action="close"]` element. _Fix submitted by lumnn in pull request [28906](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28906)_. [GitHub-29161](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29161)

<!--- ENGCOM-7585-->

<!--- ENGCOM-7949-->

*  The success message that Magento displays when a shopper adds a product to their cart from the customer account sidebar now contains a link to the shopper’s shopping cart. _Fix submitted by Ajith in pull request [27977](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27977)_. [GitHub-29097](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29097)

<!--- ENGCOM-7825-->

*  Magento now selects an empty value by default for the prefix dropdown options menu on the checkout workflow. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [28238](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28238)_. [GitHub-18823](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18823)

<!--- ENGCOM-8004-->

[GitHub-29327](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29327)

### Catalog

<!--- MC-31068-->

*  Magento now removes disabled products from a shopper’s cart before checkout. Previously, when a shopper added a product to their cart that was disabled before checkout completed, Magento removed the disabled product from the cart, but the product remained in the quote, and the shopper could not check out. [GitHub-26680](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26680)

<!--- MC-30624-->

*  Magento now sorts bestselling products as expected. Previously, both product count and the pagination of sort results were incorrect. [GitHub-25955](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25955)

<!--- ENGCOM-7292-->

*  Shoppers can now open a product’s detail page by clicking on the product name in the compare products sidebar. _Fix submitted by Eduard Chitoraga in pull request [27451](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27451)_. [GitHub-21101](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21101)

<!--- ENGCOM-7513-->

*  `children_count` values now remain positive when an administrator deletes categories. Previously, when an administrator deleted categories, the  `children_count` for remaining categories was negative. _Fix submitted by Vitaliy Prokopov in pull request [28044](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28044)_. [GitHub-27969](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27969)

<!--- MC-34314-->

*  Magento now uses the default option (**Configuration** > **Web** > **Default Layouts** > **Default Product Layout**) that you have selected for the `page_layout` attribute when creating a new product. Previously, your selected default value was not applied.

<!--- MC-34258-->

*  You can now successfully perform mass actions on Inventory product stock. Previously, when you tried to perform a mass action on inventory product stock, Magento displayed a blank page. If you performed this action with Magento in developer mode, Magento threw this error: `Notice: Undefined offset: 32000 in /Users/kodithuw/sites/m23inventory/inventory/InventoryCatalogAdminUi/view/adminhtml/templates/catalog/product/edit/action/inventory.phtml on line 24`

<!--- MC-32552-->

*  Pagination problems with the Configurable Product Edit Current Variations list have been corrected.

<!--- MC-33406-->

*  Magento no longer updates the Related Products price box whenever a shopper selects options for a configurable product. Previously, Magento updated the price box whenever a shopper selected an option for a configurable product.

<!--- MC-29882-->

*  Magento now displays the correct price for configurable products with customizable options on the Admin Create Order page. As expected, the displayed price is a sum of the child product's price and the custom option's price. Previously, Magento displayed only the custom option price. [GitHub-25766](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25766)

<!--- MC-33745-->

*  The order summary now displays the correct discount amount when a cart price rule has been applied. Previously, the rule did not correctly round amounts when calculating shipping discounts.

<!--- MC-33765-->

*  Admin user accounts created from an admin account with a restricted scope can now create a configurable product with attributes as expected. Previously, Magento threw this error: `Notice: Undefined index: value_index in 23develop/app/code/Magento/ConfigurableProduct/Helper/Product/Options/Factory.php on line 101`.

### Cookies

<!--- ENGCOM-7156-->

*  Magento now creates a maximum of one `mage-translation-file-version` and `mage-translation-storage` cookie per session. _Fix submitted by Ihor Sviziev in pull request [27364](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27364)_. [GitHub-27355](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27355)

### cron

<!--- MC-35884-->

*  Message queue consumer configuration has been extended with new parameters that help control consumers and save server resources and that potentially decrease consumer queue CPU consumption by 20%:

   *  `maxIdleTime` defines the maximum waiting time in seconds for a new message from the queue.
   *  `sleep` specifies time in seconds to sleep before checking if a new message is available in the queue.
   *  `onlySpawnWhenMessageAvailable` identifies whether a consumer should be spawned only when an available message exists in the related queue. This setting is enabled globally by default for all consumers but can be configured per consumer.

<!--- ENGCOM-7863-->

*  `cron` expressions such as  `3/10 * * * *` are now scheduled as expected. _Fix submitted by Anton Evers in pull request [28930](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28930)_. [GitHub-29240](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29240)

<!--- MC-24981-->

*  The server-side LESS compiler now imports all remote CSS files as expected when you run `bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f`. Previously, Magento did not import the remote files and threw an error. [GitHub-25119](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25119)

### Customer

<!--- MC-33679-->

*  The region names in Admin customer addresses are now translated as expected.

<!--- MC-36226-->

*  The **State/Province** fields are now populated as expected on the Edit Address page (**My Account** > **Address book**).

<!--- MC-34655-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when a customer clicks the **Submit** button multiple times on forms throughout the storefront for which invisible reCAPTCHA has been enabled. Previously, clicking this button multiple times resulted in an internal error similar to this: `Internal error: Make sure you are using reCaptcha V3 api keys`.

<!--- MC-33522-->

*  Saving a deleted customer from the Admin now generates an error message only. Previously, Magento displayed a blank page and generated a report that contains this string: `"0":"No such entity with customerId = 3","1":"#1 Magento\\Customer\\Model CustomerRegistry->retrieve() called at [app\/code\/Magento\/Customer\/Model\/ResourceModel\/CustomerRepository.php:340"`.

<!--- MC-33357-->

*  Magento now displays an error message as expected when an administrator tries to save an address for a customer whose account has just been deleted. Previously, Magento displayed a blank message box.

<!--- MC-33150-->

<!--- MC-34262-->

<!--- ENGCOM-7757-->

*  Shoppers can now download samples of downloadable products that are out-of-stock. Previously, when a shopper tried to download a sample, Magento opened a new tab, did not display an informative message, and the download process did not begin. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [28898](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28898)_. [GitHub-23638](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23638)

<!--- ENGCOM-7796-->

[GitHub-26107](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26107)

### Email

<!--- MC-32789-->

*  Magento now sends email notifications about order changes to the correct customer email if the customer email was changed after the order was created.

<!--- MC-36015-->

*  Order update emails that are sent to customers now include the correct order status. Previously, if an order status changed from `processing` to another state, the order email did not reflect the status change.

<!--- MC-34107-->

*  Magento no longer displays misleading messages about existing accounts during guest checkout. Previously, when a guest navigated to the checkout page, then navigated back to the shipping page, Magento displayed this error: `You already have an account with us. Sign in or continue as guest`.

<!--- MC-33905-->

*  Custom email templates now load the same elements as native default email templates. Previously, some elements, including variable values, were missing.

<!--- ENGCOM-7576-->

<!--- ENGCOM-7506-->

*  Product alert emails are now sent from the store from which the alert is subscribed. Previously, this email was always sent from the default store.  _Fix submitted by Maciej Pawłowski in pull request [26534](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26534)_. [GitHub-28968](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28968)

<!--- MC-33700-->

*  You can now create an email template that sends email with  `Content-Type: "text/plain”`. Previously, Magento ignored the content type specified in the template. _Fix submitted by twoonesixdigital in pull request [26474](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26474)_. [GitHub-26471](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26471)

### Frameworks

<!--- MC-35893-->

*  The **Time of day to send data** field of the Admin **Stores** > **Configuration** > GENERAL > **Advanced Reporting** page is now rendered correctly.

<!--- MC-34153-->

*  Shoppers can now change the number of orders that are displayed per page when the Orders list spans multiple pages. Previously, Magento displayed the following message when the shopper navigated to the last page of orders and tried to change the number of orders displayed per page: `You have placed no orders`. This was a known issue for Magento 2.4.0.

<!--- MC-35020-->

*  You can now add products to a category when implementing Level 2 cache.

<!--- MC-29755-->

*  `X-Magento-Tags` headers no longer exceed the size permitted by the HTTP specification. Previously, category pages that contain many products returned an `X-Magento-Tag` header that resulted in a 503 error.

<!--- MC-34257-->

*  `sales_order_shipment_track_save_commit_after` is now triggered as expected when you use REST to create a shipment.

<!--- MC-33898-->

<!--- MC-32929-->

<!--- MC-18021-->

### General fixes

<!--- MC-36048-->

*  Sorting products on the Admin (**Stores** > **Attributes** > **Products**) now displays all products that meet your search criteria. Previously, Magento did not display records, and to sort the records, you needed to navigate to the first page of search results.

<!--- MC-36343-->

*  Unnecessary quotation marks and escaping around a URL in `tracking.phtml` have been removed.

<!--- MC-35998-->

*  The `var/log/system.log` now displays a more accurate message when a user tries to access a non-existing resource file under the static directory and SCD OnDemand and production mode are enabled. Magento now logs a 404 error. Previously, Magento logged the same message that is logged when the error occurs in developer mode.

<!--- ENGCOM-7286-->

*  JavaScript minification now works correctly. The minification file resolver no longer leaks variables to global scope. Previously, `ctx`, `origNameToUrl`, and `baseUrl` variables under window were leaked. _Fix submitted by Mateusz Krzeszowiak in pull request [27622](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27622)_. [GitHub-28110](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28110)

<!--- ENGCOM-7532-->

*  When you debug an error that prevents object creation, Magento now prints as well as logs the original exception message.

[GitHub-26550](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26550)

<!--- ENGCOM-7610-->

*  Multi-page storefront orders lists now behave as expected when a shopper changes the number of results displayed per page from the second or subsequent results page. Previously, Magento displayed this error when a shopper changed the number of search results displayed in the **My Account** > **My Orders** list: `You have placed no orders`. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [28417](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28417)_. [GitHub-28488](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28488)

*  An expired persistent session is now renewed as expected when the shopper logs back in.

<!--- MC-35230-->

*  Password lifetime as set in **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **Admin** is now honored. Previously, if you clicked **Forgot password?** when prompted to reset your password, you could bypass the password reset.

<!--- MC-34369-->

*  Coupon codes are now applied only to the specified product. Previously, Magento applied the coupon code to all products in the cart. [GitHub-28246](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28246)

<!--- MC-35008-->

*  Cart expiry settings are no longer re-set when an inventory or price update occurs. Previously, when a cart was set to expire in 24 hours, and an inventory update or price update occurred, the indexers populated the `updated_at table`, which re-set the expiry time.

### Images

<!--- ENGCOM-7691-->

*  HTML markup for thumbnail images has been improved. _Fix submitted by Tu Nguyen in pull request [28642](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28642)_. [GitHub-29468](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29468)

### Import/export

<!--- MC-35479-->

<!--- ENGCOM-7616-->

*  Importing products using a CSV file  now generates an error_report.csv file as expected. Previously, Magento generated the file but removed it after the import completed. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [28460](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28460)_. [GitHub-28420](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28420)

<!--- MC-32956-->

*  The position of products in the `catalog_category_product` table now updates as expected when an administrator creates a product in the Admin and assigns it to a category. Previously, the position of new products was always assigned a 0 value.

<!--- MC-34939-->

*  Customer data is now successfully exported from the Admin, and the export data grid displays customer data as expected. Previously, an error related to memory allocation occurred during export.

<!--- MC-34657-->

*  Imported CVS files now capture related product information as expected. Previously, related product information was not consistently uploaded the first time the CVS file was imported.

<!--- MC-37424-->

*  Removed unused construct parameters in `AdvancedPricing.php`. [GitHub-29531](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29531)

### Index

<!--- ENGCOM-7073-->

*  `Magento_CacheInvalidate` now handles large tag patterns correctly when doing a `PURGE`. `sendPurgeRequest` has been refactored to handle an array of tags instead of requiring the caller to use `implode()`.

### Infrastructure

<!--- MC-37243-->

*  Problems loading catalog and product pages on deployments running PHP 7.4.9 no longer occur. Previously, Magento threw this error when you tried to load the catalog and product pages: `There has been an error processing your request. Exception printing is disabled by default for security reasons`. [GitHub-29502](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29502)

<!--- ENGCOM-7994-->

*  All exceptions that occur when layouts are rendered in production mode are now logged in the exception log file (`var/report`). Previously, Magento logged these messages in the system log as critical issues.

<!--- ENGCOM-7154-->

[GitHub-28795](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28795)

<!--- ENGCOM-7484-->

*  Plugins have been migrated out of the Magento Framework to follow the Magento best practice of prohibiting plugins in the Framework namespace. _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [27965](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27965)_.

*  The logic that checks if a redirect is internal now works correctly in the Admin when using a custom Admin domain. Previously, problems with this logic resulted in many Admin redirects to the homepage of the default store. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [29066](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29066)_. [GitHub-28943](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28943)

<!--- ENGCOM-7758-->

*  Problems with the `styles-old.less` file have been eliminated,  and linting no longer identifies errors. _Fix submitted by Tu Nguyen in pull request [28895](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28895)_. [GitHub-24004](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24004)

<!--- ENGCOM-7910-->

*  The README file for the build-in web server has been updated to include all Elasticsearch parameters. _Fix submitted by Yevhenii Dumskyi in pull request [29300](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29300)_. [GitHub-29299](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29299)

<!--- ENGCOM-7814-->

*  The `Magento\CmsUrlRewrite\Plugin\Cms\Model\Store\View::aftersSave` plugin now returns a value as expected. Previously, this plugin did not return a value, and as a result, saving a store view resulted in an error. _Fix submitted by Pieter Hoste in pull request [29035](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29035)_. [GitHub-29034](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29034)

<!--- ENGCOM-7566-->

   *  new extension to support `get/set/has/uns` magic methods (with usage of `__call`)
   *  support for SessionManager, which forwards all calls to the DataObject container
   *  test coverage for extensions
   *  updated tests for Filtered Error check
   *  increased PHPStan check level from 0 to 1. _Fix submitted by Oleksandr Kravchuk in pull request [27905](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27905)_. [GitHub-28303](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28303)

<!--- ENGCOM-7906-->

*  `ScopeConfigInterface` can now be more than a string. The restriction of `magentoConfigFixture` to string only was the inadvertent result of a previous pull request and has been reverted. _Fix submitted by Kristof, Fooman in pull request [29305](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29305)_. [GitHub-29345](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29345)

<!--- ENGCOM-8000-->

*  The `convertConfigTimeToUtc` method no longer throws a fatal error due to sending incorrect parameters to the `Phrase` constructor. _Fix submitted by Kos Rafał in pull request [29483](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29483)_. [GitHub-29525](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29525)

### Layered navigation

<!--- MC-25043-->

*  The layered navigation sidebar now shows Boolean attributes with both options (**yes**/**no**) and matching product counts. Previously, layered navigation did not return a **no** option for Boolean attributes in deployments using Elasticsearch.

<!--- ENGCOM-7493-->

*  The swatch layered navigation filter is now consistent with standard filters used throughout Magento. _Fix submitted by Bartłomiej Szubert in pull request [28015](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28015)_. [GitHub-28011](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28011)

### Media Gallery

<!--- ENGCOM-8014-->

*  The Media Gallery configuration UI (Admin **Stores**  >  **Configuration**  >   **Advanced**  >  **System** ) has been reorganized. _Fix submitted by Shankar Konar in pull request [29433](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29433)_. [GitHub-28011](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1738)

### Newsletter

<!--- MC-34714-->

*  Exporting the Newsletter Subscribers list using the `EXCEL XML`  option now results in the export of all rows as expected. Previously, exported data included only the page pagination value, not all rows.

<!--- ENGCOM-7522-->

*  Newsletter subscription emails now use the same HTML tags as other newsletter-related emails. _Fix submitted by Paweł Tylek in pull request [27357](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27357)_. [GitHub-28166](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28166)

<!--- ENGCOM-7788-->

<!--- ENGCOM-7739-->

*  Added tests for newsletter subscription for guests with a disallowed option in config statements.

[GitHub-29039](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29039)

### Orders

<!--- ENGCOM-7858-->

*  The `GetAssetIdByContentFieldInterface` and its implementation on `MediaContent` modules now permits Adobe Stock Integration to extend `MediaGallery` filter functionality. _Fix submitted by Gabriel da Gama in pull request [29058](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29058)_. [GitHub-1464](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/1464)

<!--- ENGCOM-7885-->

*  The `CustomerAddressId` values for a newly created customer are now validated in quotes.  _Fix submitted by Andrii Kalinich in pull request [29139](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29139)_. [GitHub-28793](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28793)

<!--- ENGCOM-7798-->

*  The order status for a credit memo with zero total is now `Closed`. Previously, Magento report its order status as `Complete`. _Fix submitted by Andrii Kalinich in pull request [29023](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29023)_. [GitHub-22762](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22762)

### Payment methods

<!--- MC-34363-->

*  Magento now displays a message that prompts you to enter mandatory credit card data when you click **Submit** for an Admin order without entering valid payment information. Previously, the Braintree card validator did not throw an error when payment input fields were invalid and the page became inactive.

<!--- MC-33494-->

*  You can now change the shipping method for an order you create from the Admin for a customer whose account has a stored credit card (Braintree). Previously, when you selected a different shipping method, the stored card was not selected, and Magento did not place the order.

#### PayPal

<!--- MC-33879-->

*  The Order Review page of the checkout workflow now displays the correct shipping amount for PayPal through Braintree orders for which the shipping method has been changed during checkout. Previously, when a customer changed the shipping method on the PayPal Order Review page of the checkout workflow, Magento did not update the order total with the correct method.

<!--- MC-34152-->

*  Merchants can now successfully cancel orders that were authorized using PayPal. Previously, Magento did not cancel the order and displayed this error:  `Declined: 10601-Authorization has expired`.

<!--- MC-33330-->

*  Magento no longer empties your cart when you cancel an order by closing the PayPal payment popup window after first completing another order.

### Performance

<!--- MC-31617-->

*  Plugin list configuration is now generated during the execution of the `di:compile` command. This configuration information is written to generated metadata folders based on scope. Previously, this information was stored in cache. Resulting performance improvements include:

   *  Network cache size has decreased by 10 - 15%
   *  Execution time for many scenarios has been improved by 3%.

<!--- ENGCOM-7290-->

*  Magento now loads the appropriate slider widget on demand, which has improved page loading. The touch slider widget customization has been moved to a separate file so it can be loaded only on compatible devices. The appropriate slider widget type is now loaded only when range binding is actually used on the page. _Fix submitted by Mateusz Krzeszowiak in pull request [27616](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27616)_. [GitHub-28807](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28807)

<!--- MC-33107-->

*  The performance of checkout with multiple simultaneous orders has been improved.

<!--- MC-25062-->

*  Deadlocks no longer occur when the import process executes a bulk insert and the re-index process simultaneously executes a large insert from select. Previously, Magento displayed this error:`PDOException: SQLSTATE[40001]: Serialization failure: 1213 Deadlock found when trying to get lock`. [GitHub-8933](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8933)

### Reviews

<!--- MC-33405-->

*  A unique key for `entity_pk_value-entity_type-store_id` has been added to the `review_entity_summary` table, which prevents the creation of duplicate rows for the same product ID (`entity_pk_value`). Previously, this lack of unique key resulted in duplicate rows for the same product ID and SQL errors.

### Sales

<!--- MC-35675-->

*  Magento no longer assigns a status of Complete after invoicing to an order that requires zero payment.

<!--- MC-35888-->

*  The New Shipment email generated by the REST API now contains the same shipping and customer information as shipments that are created manually from the Admin. Previously, this email did not contain the customer name, tracking information, products ordered, and other order information.

<!--- MC-35837-->

*  Guest user names are now visible as expected in invoice- and shipment-related emails when the emails are loaded or customized from the Admin.

<!--- MC-35707-->

*  The PDF invoice is now translated into the language of the store view where the order has been placed. Previously, the PDF invoice was translated in the language of the Admin.

<!--- MC-35858-->

*  You can now issue a refund as expected from the credit memo page. [GitHub-29014](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29014)

<!--- MC-35353-->

*  Localised region names that are displayed on the storefront Order page are now correctly translated. Previously, the region name was not based on the specified locale unless it was edited in the Admin.

<!--- MC-35633-->

*  Shipments created through the POST `/rest/V1/shipment` endpoint now update orders properly. Previously,  Magento created a shipment, but shipment status remained in the processing state.

### Search

<!--- MC-31304-->

*  You can now search for products by attribute from the Admin Customer view using QuickSearch. Previously, an exception occurred on the catalog search result page.

<!--- MC-32518-->

*  Magento now displays configurable products on the category page as expected after you add a product attribute.

<!--- MC-33952-->

*  Elasticsearch results now include the correct values for each store view’s attribute options. If a Dropdown or Multiple Select attribute has a different option value in the non-default store view than in the default store view, Elasticsearch now indexes that value or returns the product with that value in the results. Previously, Elasticsearch did not index that value or return the product with that value in the results.

<!--- MC-35013-->

*  Searching by SKU now works as expected in advanced search with Elasticsearch. Previously, when you tried to search by SKU, Magento displayed this error message: `We can't find any items matching these search criteria. Modify your search`.

<!--- ENGCOM-7222-->

*  Advanced search no longer lets shoppers filter on negative prices. _Fix submitted by Rohan Hapani in pull request [27359](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27359)_. [GitHub-27358](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27358)

<!--- ENGCOM-7917-->

*  Scope values are now reset as expected on the New Synonym Group form. _Fix submitted by Sathish Subramanian in pull request [29206](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29206)_. [GitHub-28947](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28947)

### Shipping

<!--- MC-34734-->

*  Magento now calculates shipping table rates correctly after upgrade. Previously, shipping table rates were calculated based on net price, which excluded VAT.

<!--- MC-33737-->

*  Magento now displays shipping rates in the correct currency in the checkout workflow for orders specifying FedEx as the shipping method.

<!--- MC-33267-->

*  Multi-page PDFs of shipping labels for orders shipped by UPS now display the correct count.

<!--- MC-35514-->

*  Problems with the JavaScript components of the Create Packages page have been resolved. Previously, Magento did not display the **Create Shipping Label** checkbox on this page, and you could not create a shipping label for an existing order.

### Sitemap

<!--- ENGCOM-7924-->

*  The sitemap in `robots.txt` is now store-specific.  _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [29331](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29331)_. [GitHub-28901](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28901)

<!--- MC-34617-->

*  Encoded values are now correctly escaped in the `sitemap.xml` file. Previously, when you included encoded characters in a product name or image title, the generated sitemap was invalid.

### Store

<!--- MC-35853-->

*  Deleting a previously created store view no longer results in an error in deployments with a split database configuration. Previously, Magento threw an exception.

<!--- MC-32634-->

*  You can now export `config.php` and default website code from one website to install and configure Magento on a second website in a multi website deployment. Previously, the default store and view disappeared after the export, and errors occurred on the storefront.

### Swagger

<!--- ENGCOM-7720-->

*  You can now generate a customer token with Swagger. Previously, Swagger did not generate a response code when valid customer access information was entered, and Magento displayed this error:  `The account sign-in was incorrect or your account is disabled temporarily. Please wait and try again later`. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [28822](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28822)_. [GitHub-27098](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27098)

### Swatches

<!--- ENGCOM-7845-->

*  Configurable products with swatches now show tier pricing when a shopper clicks **Edit** in the cart. Previously, Magento did not display tier prices in the cart before checkout. _Fix submitted by Sathish Subramanian in pull request [29137](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29137)_. [GitHub-28270](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28270)

<!--- MC-33147-->

*  Magento now displays tier prices as expected for configurable product variations.

### Tax

<!--- MC-36049-->

*  Magento no longer displays a fixed product tax attribute on the storefront for a product after a merchant has unassigned it from the product’s attribute set.

### Test

<!--- ENGCOM-7995-->

*  Added unit tests for approving a purchase order that was made with a discount that has since expired will place order at full amount and not update purchase order total. _Fix submitted by Joan He in pull request [18](https://github.com/magento/partners-magento2-infrastructure/pull/18)_. [GitHub-204](https://github.com/magento/partners-magento2b2b/issues/204)

<!--- ENGCOM-8003-->

*  `SynchronizeFilesInterface` is now covered by integration tests.   _Fix submitted by jmonteros422 in pull request [29493](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29493)_. [GitHub-1742](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/1742)

<!--- ENGCOM-8009-->

*  A function has been added to `\Magento\TestFramework\TestCase\WebapiAbstract` that enables the comparison of large nested arrays of expected and actual outcomes in tests and permits testers to ignore irrelevant keys in the actual outcome._Fix submitted by Jekabs in pull request [29458](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29458)_. [GitHub-29498](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29498)

### Theme

<!--- MC-34397-->

*  Themes that are added in User Agent Rules are now affected as expected when you run `bin/magento catalog:images:resize`. Previously, only themes that were assigned to stores were affected when `bin/magento catalog:images:resize` was run.

### Translation and locales

<!--- MC-20372-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when an administrator changes the **Date** field during Admin product creation or save when the Admin locale is Chinese or Japanese. [GitHub-24696](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24696)

<!--- ENGCOM-7536-->

<!--- ENGCOM-7521-->

*  The term FPT can now be translated on Admin  **Stores**  > **Configuration**  > **Sales**  > **Tax**  > **Fixed Product Taxes**. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [28108](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28108)_. [GitHub-5477](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/5477)

### UI

<!--- ENGCOM-7514-->

*  The privacy and cookie policy link in the page footer of the privacy and cookie policy pages no longer active. _Fix submitted by Sathish Subramanian in pull request [28004](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28004)_. [GitHub-27985](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27985)

<!--- MC-35313-->

*  The **Add selections to my cart** button on the bottom of the shopping cart now works as expected. This was a known issue in Magento 2.4.0.

[GitHub-29416](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29416)

<!--- ENGCOM-8015-->

*  Magento now removes tags for Adobe Stock images after a merchant deletes the tags and saves the image details.

[GitHub-1703](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1703)

### URL rewrites

### Web API framework

<!--- MC-35838-->

*  Merchants with multiple websites can now use the REST API to create and update products while preserving  image and image-role inheritance. Previously, when a merchant used the REST API to create and update products, and a product was updated for store view, the default image roles were loaded and saved for that store view. As a result, the store-view image roles stopped inheriting from the default scope after update.

<!--- MC-36419-->

*  An unscoped integration user account can now access a resource through the REST API when resource permissions allow access.

<!--- MC-35975-->
