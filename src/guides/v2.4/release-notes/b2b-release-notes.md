### Known Issues

-  Magento throws an exception during upgrade to B2B 1.2.0 in a multi-website deployment. When `setup:upgrade` runs, this error occurs on the `PurchaseOrder` module: `Module Magento_PurchaseOrder: Unable to apply data patch Magento\PurchaseOrder\Setup\Patch\Data\InitPurchaseOrderSalesSequence for moduleMagento_PurchaseOrder`. **Workaround**: Install the **B2B-716 Add NonTransactionableInterface interface to the InitPurchaseOrderSalesSequence data patch** hotfix, which is now available from the **My Account** > **Downloads** section of `magento.com`.
-  If a discount code expires before a Purchase Order (PO) is approved, the PO continues to display the discounted amount, but once the PO is approved, the order is placed at the non-discounted total. **Workaround**: Install the **B2B-709 Purchase Order Discount patch** hotfix for this issue, which is now available from the **My Account** > **Downloads** section of `magento.com`.
-  If items in a purchase order are out-of-stock, or of insufficient quantity when the purchase order is converted into an actual order, an error will occur. If backorders are enabled, the order will be processed normally.
