## Magento B2B - Version 1.2.0

-  {:.fix} Now, you can click the Approve, Cancel, Reject, and Purchase Purchase Order buttons only once. Previously, you could click the button multiple times.
-  {:.fix} The Purchase Order Approve, Reject, Cancel, and Validate buttons now render correctly on mobile devices.
-  {:.fix} Previously, approving a Purchase Order with a discount that has expired placed the order at the full amount and did not update the Purchase Order total. This now works correctly.
-  {:.fix} A bug was introduced in 2.3.4 where custom extension attributes would not be copied from the Customer Address to the Quote Address. This bug has been fixed.
-  {:.fix} With B2B installed, a SQL error would appear when assigning categories to shared catalogs. This bug has been fixed.
-  {:.fix} Due to an incorrect variable type value, admins could not add configurable products to an order. The option dropdowns would not populate. This feature now works properly.
-  {:.fix} Previously, when editing Category Permissions for the Not Logged In group, an error would occur when saving the changes. This bug has now been fixed.
-  {:.fix} A bug has been fixed that now allows admins to add products to an order that are not in the shared catalog. Previously, an error message would appear when adding an item not in the catalog.
-  {:.fix} Previously, after running the command `php bin/magento indexer:set-dimensions-mode catalog_product_price website` and then trying to create a shared catalog, an error would occur. This bug has been fixed.
-  {:.fix} When adding a new company and assigning the Company Administrator to a non-default website, the wrong site ID was sent, causing an error. This bug has now been fixed.
-  {:.fix} Previously, after a customer was moved to another customer group, adding a product to an order via Quick View would fail with an error. This bug has now been fixed.
-  {:.fix} Previously, when attempting to checkout using the WebAPI with a B2B quote, an incorrect value was sent to the API, causing an error to occur. This bug has been fixed.
-  {:.fix} Previously, when setting a company to "Active" via the API, an error would occur. This bug has now been fixed.
-  {:.fix} Due to an unneeded `form` tag, the page would refresh when you press Enter after changing a proposed shipping charge. This has been fixed.
-  {:.fix} Previously, when setting a product display limit on a catalog page and that limit was less than the number of total products, an error occurred. That feature now works as expected.
-  {:.fix} Previously, when changing the admin of a company, the original admin address would be copied to the new admin, giving them two addresses. Now, only the correct address is added.
-  {:.fix} Previously, using the API to save a quote item when backorder is set to "Allowed and Notify Customer" would fail. This API call now works as expected.
-  {:.fix} The Fixed Product Tax is now displayed on the Quotes detail page.
