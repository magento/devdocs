{{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.2-p2 is a security release that provides 18 security fixes that enhance your Magento 2.4.2 deployment. Merchants can now install time-sensitive security fixes without applying the hundreds of functional fixes and enhancements that a full quarterly release provides. Patch 2.4.2-p2 provides fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in our previous quarterly release, {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.2 and {{ site.data.var.ce }} 2.4.2.

## Apply `AC-3022.patch` to continue offering DHL as a shipping carrier

DHL has introduced schema version 6.2 and will deprecate schema version 6.0 in the near future. Adobe Commerce 2.4.4 and earlier versions that support the DHL integration support only version 6.0. Merchants deploying these releases should apply `AC-3022.patch` at their earliest convenience to continue offering DHL as a shipping carrier. See the [Apply a patch to continue offering DHL as shipping carrier](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/7707818131597-Apply-a-patch-to-continue-offering-DHL-as-shipping-carrier) Knowledge Base article for information about downloading and installing the patch.

## What's in this release?

Eighteen security fixes are included in this security patch. See [Adobe Security Bulletin](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb21-64.html).

Security patches typically include all hotfixes that have been released for the preceding complete release. However, no hot fixes have been released for {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.2 and {{ site.data.var.ce }} 2.4.2.
