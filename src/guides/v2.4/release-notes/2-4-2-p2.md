---

{{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.2-p2 is a security-only release that provides 18 security fixes that enhance your Magento 2.4.2 deployment. Merchants can now install time-sensitive security fixes without applying the hundreds of functional fixes and enhancements that a full quarterly release provides. Patch 2.4.2-p2 provides fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in our previous quarterly release, {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.2 and {{ site.data.var.ce }} 2.4.2.
## What's in this release?

Eighteen security fixes are included in this security patch. See [Adobe Security Bulletin](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb21-64.html).

Security-only patches typically include all hotfixes that have been released for the preceding complete release. However, no hot fixes have been released for {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.2 and {{ site.data.var.ce }} 2.4.2.
