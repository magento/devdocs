title: Magento Commerce 2.4.0 Release Notes
---

Magento Commerce 2.4.0 introduces support for PHP 7.4, Elasticsearch 7.6.x, and MySQL 8.0. Substantial security changes include the enablement of two-factor authentication in the Admin by default. B2B enhancements include the new Order Approval workflow.

**With this release, the Authorize.Net, eWay, CyberSource, and Worldpay payment method integrations have been removed from core code. Merchants should migrate to the official extensions that are available on the Magento Marketplace**.

{:.bs-callout-info}

**Braintree payment integration**: Prior to Magento 2.4.0, it was recommended that merchants install and configure the official Braintree payment integration extension from the Magento Marketplace to replace the core integration. With this release (Magento 2.4.0), the extension is now included in the Magento release. Merchants must follow additional steps to ensure that Braintree works properly in a Magento 2.4.0 deployment. See [Braintree](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/payment/braintree.html) for more information on how to migrate to Magento 2.4.0.

This release includes all the improvements to core quality that were included in Magento 2.3.5-p1, over 100 new fixes to core code, and 30 security enhancements. It includes the resolution of 226 GitHub issues by our community members. These community contributions range from minor clean-up of core code to significant enhancements in Inventory Management and GraphQL.

{:.bs-callout-info}

Minor releases bring substantial code enhancements. Before upgrading to Magento 2.4.0, confirm that your environment meets the minimal [technical stack requirements](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/system-requirements-tech.html).

{:.bs-callout-info}

Quarterly releases may contain backward-incompatible changes (BIC). Magento 2.4.0 contains minor backward-incompatible changes. To review minor backward-incompatible changes, see [BIC reference]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/reference.html). (Major backward-incompatible issues are described in [BIC highlights]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/index.html). Not all releases introduce major BICs.)

{:.bs-callout-info}

The package names of security-only releases are typically appended with -p1. However, we could not avoid deviating from these naming conventions with Magento 2.3.5, which in turn has had a temporary ripple effect on the subsequent security package names. Specifically, the full-feature Magento 2.3.5 release is Magento 2.3.5-p1. The security-only release that we will release when Magento 2.4.0 GAs will be Magento 2.3.5-p2. We hope to return to the usual naming conventions in future releases.

## Security-only patch available

Merchants can now install time-sensitive security fixes without applying the hundreds of functional fixes and enhancements that a full quarterly release (for example, Magento 2.3.5-p2) provides. Patch 2.3.5.2 (Composer package 2.3.5-p2) is a security-only patch that provides fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in our previous quarterly release, Magento 2.3.5-p1. All hot fixes that were applied to the 2.3.5 release are included in this security-only patch. (A *hot fix* provides a fix to a released version of Magento that addresses a specific problem or bug.)

For general information about security-only patches, see the Magento DevBlog post [Introducing the New Security-only Patch Release](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Introducing-the-New-Security-only-Patch-Release/ba-p/141287). For instructions on downloading and applying security-only patches (including patch 2.3.5-p2), see [Install Magento using Composer]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/composer.html). Security-only patches include security bug fixes only, not the additional security enhancements that are included in the full patch.

## Other release information

Although code for these features is bundled with quarterly releases of the Magento core code, several of these projects (for example, B2B, Page Builder, Inventory Management, and Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Studio) are also released independently. Bug fixes for these projects are documented in the separate, project-specific release information that is available in the documentation for each project.

## Highlights

Look for the following highlights in this release:

### Substantial security enhancements

This release includes over 30 security fixes and platform security improvements.

#### Over 30 security enhancements that help close remote code execution (RCE) and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities

No confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. Most of these issues require that an attacker first obtains access to the Admin. As a result, we remind you to take all necessary steps to protect your Admin, including but not limited to these efforts: IP allowlisting, [two-factor authentication]({{page.baseurl}}/security/two-factor-authentication.html), use of a VPN, the use of a unique location rather than `/admin`, and good password hygiene. See [Security Updates Available for Magento](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb20-47.html) for a discussion of these fixed issues.

#### Additional security enhancements

*  **Implementation of 2FA for Admin accounts, Magento.com user accounts, and Cloud SSH access**

   *  **Securing your Magento Admin account**. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is now required for the Magento Admin. Admin users must first configure their 2FA before logging into the Admin through either the UI or a web API. 2FA is enabled by default. We strongly recommend against disabling the 2FA module.  This extra step of authentication makes it harder for malicious users to log in to the Admin without authorization. See [Two-factor Authentication (2FA)]({{page.baseurl}}/security/two-factor-authentication.html). <!--- MC-22631-->

   *  **Securing your Magento account**. Two-factor Authentication (2FA) provides an added, optional  layer of security to better protect your Magento.com account from unauthorized users who might want to use your account in ways you do not want. See [Securing Your Account](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/magento/magento-account-secure.html).

   *  **Securing Cloud SSH access**. {{ site.data.var.ece }} provides multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement to manage authentication requirements for SSH access to Cloud environments. Multi-factor authentication for 2FA is not enabled by default on a project.  Magento highly recommends enabling this feature. Contact Support for assistance. See [Enable multi-factor authentication for SSH access](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/project/project-enable-mfa-enforcement.html).

*  **Template filter strict mode is now enabled by default**. Magento components (including CMS pages and blocks) that use the template filter in legacy mode can be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE). Enabling strict mode by default ensures that RCE attacks cannot be deliberately enabled. <!--- MC-22982-->

*  **Data rendering for UI data providers is now disabled by default**. This removes an opportunity for malicious users to execute arbitrary JavaScript. <!--- MC-17356-->

*  **New `\Magento\Framework\Escaper` class**. This class is provided for `.phtml` templates and the PHP classes that are responsible for generating HTML. This class contains HTML sanitization methods relevant to multiple contexts. The `$escaper` local variable is available inside `.phtml` templates and should be used instead of the deprecated `$block->escape{method}`. Use `$escaper` rather than `$block` as the use of `$block->escape{method}` has been deprecated.

*  **Support for security.txt file**. This file is an industry-standard file on the server that helps security researchers report potential security issues to site administrators.

{:.bs-callout-info}
Starting with the release of Magento Commerce 2.3.2, Magento will assign and publish indexed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers with each security bug reported to us by external parties. This allows users of Magento Commerce to more easily identify unaddressed vulnerabilities in their deployment. You can learn more about CVE identifiers at [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/).

### Platform upgrades

The following platform upgrades help enhance website security and performance. Supported versions of PHP and PHPUnit, Elasticsearch, MySQL, and other dependencies are listed in [Magento 2.4 technology stack requirements]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/system-requirements-tech.html).

*  **PHP 7.4 support introduced and PHP 7.1 and 7.2 deprecated**. Magento 2.4.0 introduces support for PHP 7.4.

*  **Support for PHPUnit 9.x and deprecation of PHPUnit 6.5**. PHP 7.4 requires the use of the latest PHPUnit testing framework, which is PHPUnit 9.x. Magento Marketplace extension vendors must confirm that all new extension versions are compatible with PHP 7.4 and that all  unit and integration tests have been configured to be run with PHPUnit 9.

*  **Elasticsearch 7.6.x support**. Elasticsearch 7.6.x is now the default catalog search engine for Magento Commerce and Open Source. You cannot install or upgrade to Magento 2.4.0 without also installing Elasticsearch 7.6.x. Elasticsearch version 2.x code has been removed. Elasticsearch versions 5.x and 6.x have been deprecated and are no longer supported. See [Elasticsearch]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/prereq/elasticsearch.html).

*  **MySQL 8.0 support**. Magento 2.4.x supports MySQL 8.x. (Magento 2.4.0 was tested with MySQL 8.0.20.) Merchants are encouraged to migrate their deployments to MySQL 8.x to take advantage of its improved performance, security, and reliability. Although MySQL 5.7 is still supported for Magento 2.4.x, MySQL 5.6 is no longer supported. You cannot host Magento 2.4.x with a MySQL 5.6 database. See [MySQL]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/prereq/mysql.html).

*  **MariaDB 10.4 support**. Support for MySQL 8.0 provides the opportunity for merchants to deploy MariaDB 10.4 with Magento. Although merchants can still use MariaDB 10.2 with Magento 2.4.0, we recommend upgrading to MariaDB 10.4 for improved performance and reliability. MariaDB 10.0 and 10.1 are no longer supported (as a result of removing support for MySQL 5.6 in this release).
*  **Removal of the MySQL catalog search engine**. The MySQL search engine has been removed from Magento 2.4.0 and replaced as the default search engine with Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch provides superior search capabilities as well as catalog performance optimizations.  All merchants must have Elasticsearch to install and deploy Magento 2.4.0. See [Check the catalog search engine]({{page.baseurl}}/comp-mgr/prereq/prereq-elasticsearch.html).

*  **Migration of dependencies on Zend Framework to the [Laminas project](https://getlaminas.org/about/foundation)** to reflect the transitioning of Zend Framework to the Linux Foundation’s Laminas Project. Zend Framework has been deprecated. See the [Migration of Zend Framework to the Laminas Project](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Migration-of-Zend-Framework-to-the-Laminas-Project/ba-p/443251) DevBlog post.

*  **Decomposition of Magento Controllers** allows extension developers to implement ActionInterface directly without "layer supertype" classes. See the [Decomposition of Magento Controllers](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Decomposition-of-Magento-Controllers/ba-p/430883) DevBlog post. _Enhancement started by Vinai Kopp in pull request [16268](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16268) and finalized by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [26778](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26778)_. [GitHub-9582](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9582)

*  **Removal of the core integration of the Signifyd fraud protection code**. This core feature is no longer supported. Merchants should migrate to the [Signifyd Fraud & Chargeback Protection extension](https://marketplace.magento.com/signifyd-module-connect.html) that is available on the Magento Marketplace.

*  The **core Braintree module has been removed from the code base**. The Braintree Payments module now provides the same feature set. See [Braintree Payments](https://marketplace.magento.com/paypal-module-braintree.html).

*  The Internet Explorer 11.x browser is no longer supported.

### Infrastructure improvements

This release contains enhancements to core quality, which improve the quality of the Framework and these modules: Customer Account, Catalog, CMS, Import, Cart and Checkout, and B2B.

*  **Removal of core integration of third-party payment methods**. With this release, the Authorize.Net payment method integration has been removed from core code. Merchants should migrate to the official extension that is available on the Magento Marketplace. See the [Deprecation of Magento core payment integrations](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Deprecation-of-Magento-core-payment-integrations/ba-p/426445) devblog post. <!--- MC-29029-->

*  **Support for partial-word search for Elasticsearch (new default search engine)**. Elasticsearch now supports the use of  partial words in search terms for  product names and SKUs when using quick search. This capability was supported by the MySQL search engine, which has been deprecated and replaced by Elasticsearch in this release.

*  **PayPal JavaScript SDK upgrade**. We’ve migrated the PayPal Express Checkout integration to the latest PayPal JavaScript SDK, an SDK that  automatically collects and passes needed risk parameters to PayPal. The behavior of the PayPal Express Checkout payment method remains unchanged. However, upgrading this SDK to the latest version let merchants access the latest features and security enhancements. <!--- MC-30962-->

*  **Deprecation and removal of the Web Set Up Wizard**. You must use the command line to install or upgrade Magento 2.4.0. See [Install Magento](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli.html).

*  **Composer update plugin**. Composer plugin streamlines the  upgrade process by resolving changes that must be made to the root project `composer.json` file before updating to a new Magento product requirement. This plug-in protects against overwriting customizations. See [Upgrade using the Magento composer root plugin](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/comp-mgr/cli/cli-upgrade.html).

*  **Seller-assisted shopping**. This feature allows merchants to view the storefront on behalf of their customers. Customers opt to allow storefront access to their accounts. This community-developed feature includes an original extension developed by [MAGEFAN](https://magefan.com/). See [Seller Assisted Shopping](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/customers/login-as-customer.html). Features include:

   *  ACL to control which administrators can log in to customer accounts can be configured on a per-website basis
   *  Compatibility with multiple websites and customer account scopes
   *  Orders placed on behalf of customers are logged in the storefront and Admin
   *  All sessions are destroyed following administrator logout, and administrators cannot access customer passwords.

### Performance improvements

*  **Improvements to customer data section invalidation logic**. This release introduces a new way of invalidating all customer sections data that avoids a known issue with local storage when custom `sections.xml` invalidations are active.  (Previously, private content (local storage) was not correctly populated when you had a custom *etc/frontend/sections.xml* with action invalidations.) See [Private content]({{page.baseurl}}/extension-dev-guide/cache/page-caching/private-content.html).

*  **Multiple optimizations to Redis performance**. The enhancements minimize the number of queries to Redis that are performed on each Magento request. These optimizations include:

   *  Decrease in the size of network data transfers between Redis and Magento

   *  Reduction in Redis’ consumption of CPU cycles by improving the adapter’s ability to automatically determine what needs to be loaded

   *  Reduction in race conditions on Redis write operations

   See [Use Redis for the Magento page and default cache]({{page.baseurl}}/config-guide/redis/redis-pg-cache.html) and [Configure caching]({{page.baseurl}}/config-guide/cache.html).

*  **Improved caching of results of SQL queries to inventory tables**. These enhancements include:

   *  Caching of SQL queries to the `inventory_stock_sales_channel` table (1 query instead of 16)

   *  Caching of result of queries to the `inventory_stock` table (1 query instead of 16)

*  **Improvement of up to 25-30% to Quick Order add-to-cart performance**.

*  Merchants can now use [lazy loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading) to load images. See [Configure theme properties](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/frontend-dev-guide/themes/theme-images.html).

### Adobe Stock Integration v2.0

**Ability to license stock image previews from the Media Gallery**. Merchants can now find any Adobe Stock preview image in the Media Gallery, which reduces the number of steps required to license stock preview image.

### New Media Gallery

This replacement for the former Media Gallery offers a new, searchable interface for Magento media assets. Administrators can now search, filter, and sort images up to 30x faster than they could in the earlier version of this feature. Merchants can use this tool to evaluate storefront image usage. Extension developers should be aware that extensions that were developed for the Media Gallery will not work as expected with the new Media Gallery.

### Page Builder

Page Builder now supports PHP 7.4.

### Inventory Management

Inventory Management enhancements for this release include support for in-store pickup and bundle product support. See [Inventory Management release notes]({{page.baseurl}}/inventory/release-notes.html) for a more detailed discussion of recent Inventory Management bug fixes.

### GraphQL

GraphQL enhancements include:

*  `pickupLocations` query supports the Inventory In-store pickup feature
*  `categories` query returns a list of categories that match a specified filter. This query differs from the `categoryList` query in that it supports pagination.
*  `reorderItems` mutation allows a logged-in user to add all the products from a previous order into their cart.

See  the [GraphQL Developer Guide]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/) for details on this and other enhancements. See [Release notes]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/release-notes.html) for a detailed discussion of recent GraphQL bug fixes.

### PWA Studio

See [Magento compatibility](https://magento.github.io/pwa-studio/technologies/magento-compatibility/) for a list of PWA Studio versions and their compatible Magento core versions. For information about enhancements and bug fixes, see [PWA Studio releases](https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio/releases).

### B2B

**Order Approval Workflow feature for B2B**. Order Approvals allows managers of buying organizations to configure approval rules for their buyers. See [Approval Rules](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/customers/account-dashboard-approval-rules.html
). Features include:

*  Self-service configuration of unique approval rules for each Company account
*  Rule criteria that can be based on order amount, number of line items, or shipment cost with configurable thresholds
*  Customizable permissions for all aspects of the feature
*  Quick storefront view of Purchase Orders that require approval
*  Full history log of actions that have been performed on each Purchase Order
*  Email notification for relevant parties  during all steps in the approval process.

This release also includes multiple bug fixes. See [B2B Release Notes]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/b2b-release-notes.html).

### Magento Functional Testing Framework (MFTF)

MFTF v3.0.0 includes these new features and includes support for PHP 7.4 and PHPUnit 9:

*  MFTF helpers, which can create custom actions outside of the test framework
*  schema updates for test entities
*  sub-folders in test modules
*  nested assertion syntax
*  static check that checks and reports references to deprecated test entities

This release also removes deprecated actions and upgrades scripts that were added to upgrade tests to MFTF major version requirements.

### Vendor-developed extension enhancements

This release of Magento includes extensions developed by third-party vendors. It introduces both quality and UX improvements to these extensions and an expansion of MFTF coverage.

Magento Marketplace extension vendors should confirm that their extensions are compatible with PHP 7.4 when publishing a new version of their extension for Magento 2.4.0.

#### dotdigital

This release includes these enhancements:

*  Customer attribute values that are captured by any input type (for example, dropdown, multi-select) are now correctly synced as data fields.
*  Cart insight data is now sent for all active quotes, even if they contain no items. This allows merchants to exit contacts from a program if they empty their cart.
*  Merchants can now sync website name, store name, and store view name by individual data fields.
*  Wishlist, Review, and Order syncs now look up the transactional data sync limit once only.
*  Logging output from the Client class has been improved and is now consistent across all methods in the API wrapper.
*  Configurable products now have a stock figure that is the sum of their child products.
*  A new plugin detects stock updates that are performed by third-party code (outside the Magento Admin).
*  [Data mapping](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/dotdigital/data-mapping.html) and [transactional email](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/dotdigital/transactional-emails.html) configuration information has been updated.

Yotpo Ratings and Reviews are integrated with Page Builder.

## Fixed issues

We have fixed hundreds of issues in the Magento 2.4.0 core code.

### Installation, upgrade, deployment

<!--- MC-23940-->

*  You can now successfully remove a website along with the website’s scope-specific configuration settings in `app/etc/config.php` as expected. Previously, when you tried to remove the website, the operation failed, and Magento displayed this error: `The website with code xxx that was requested wasn't found. Verify the website and try again`. Additionally, Magento displayed this error on the storefront: `Config files have changed. Run app:config:import or setup:upgrade command to synchronize configuration`. [GitHub-24061](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24061)

<!--- MC-30140-->

*  Configuration settings that are disabled in `index.php` are no longer editable from the Admin.

<!--- MC-32405-->

*  Magento installation now completes successfully, and stores are created as expected, when store configuration is pre-defined in `config.php`.

<!--- MC-33151-->

*  `\Magento\Store\App\Config\Source\RuntimeConfigSource::getEntities` has been refactored to decrease the number of `SHOW TABLE STATUS` queries it makes. (This change reverts to the behavior this function displayed in Magento 2.3.3.)

<!--- MC-23890-->

*  Data scripts are no longer re-run whenever you attempt to upgrade the database by running `bin/magento setup:upgrade`. Previously, upgrade scripts were re-run unnecessarily, which affected performance. [GitHub-19469](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19469)

<!--- MC-30397-->

*  Magento now displays the following behaviors when your connection to Redis is interrupted. Previously, Magento did not reload the current page and displayed this error: `An error has happened during application run. See exception log for details`.

   *  Admin and storefront sessions expire
   *  Admin and storefront users must log in again
   *  Session data is saved to `var/session/`
   *  No error or exceptions are logged.

<!--- ENGCOM-6686-->

*  The `bin/magento setup:di:compile` command no longer fails with anonymous classes. _Fix submitted by Yevhen Sentiabov in pull request [26533](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26533)_. [GitHub-26532](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26532), [GitHub-21555](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21555)

[GitHub-23619](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23619)

<!--- ENGCOM-6367-->

*  You no longer need to have a writeable `env.php` file when switching to maintenance mode. Instead, Magento sets the `no-cache` headers for all frontend requests in maintenance mode (`Cache-Control`). Previously, you could not enable maintenance mode when `env.php` was read-only, and Magento tried to disable the FPC when switching into maintenance mode. _Fix submitted by Marco K̦pcke in pull request [25790](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25790)_. [GitHub-24229](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24229)

<!--- ENGCOM-7236-->

*  `db-ssl-verify`  no longer results in an undefined index error during a `ddev` setup. _Fix submitted by Daniel Ruf in pull request [26763](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26763)_. [GitHub-26762](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26762)

<!--- ENGCOM-6247-->

*  Composer dependencies have been updated to implement Redis key expiry, which has improved Redis performance. _Fix submitted by toxix in pull request [25488](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25488)_. [GitHub-25487](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25487)

### AdminGWS

<!--- MC-33031-->

*  Administrators with limited role scope can now modify alt text, and Magento saves those values. If an administrator is not permitted to modify alt text, then the alt text box is grayed out.

### Adobe Stock Integration

<!--- ENGCOM-6507-->

*  CSS styles have been added to the Adobe Stock image display to support highlighting the selected image.  _Fix submitted by Serhiy Zhovnir in pull request [25864](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25864)_. [GitHub-761](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/761)

<!--- ENGCOM-7021-->

*  Navigation through Adobe Stock preview images is no longer triggered by moving the input field cursor using arrow keys.  _Fix submitted by Adarsh Manickam in pull request [27138](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27138)_. [GitHub-973](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/973)

<!-- ENGCOM-6840-->

*  Magento now caches messages for errors that occur when a customer tries to apply a filter to Adobe Stock images. _Fix submitted by Shankar Konar in pull request [26502](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26502)_. [GitHub-863](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/863)

<!-- ENGCOM-7195-->

*  Magento no longer saves a preview of an Adobe Stock image when you move the cursor to the window’s left vertical scroll bar after clicking **Save Preview** but not confirming the save operation. _Fix submitted by Serhiy Zhovnir in pull request [27399](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27399)_. [GitHub-1002](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1002)

### Analytics

<!--- MC-32086-->

*  The analytics report for a store is now available as expected after you change the store's URL. Previously, when you tried to access the report after the URL was changed, Magento displayed a 404 error.

<!--- MC-32085-->

*  Data sync for analytics reports are now enabled as expected when AR subscriptions are enabled.

### Backend

<!--- MC-25036-->

*  Email templates (**Admin** > **Marketing** > **Communications** > **Email Templates**) can now be previewed from the Admin when JavaScript minification is enabled. Previously, when you tried to preview an email template, the Email Preview popup window was empty. [GitHub-25068](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25068)

<!--- ENGCOM-6433-->

*  Administrators can now log into the Admin as expected after an administrator account with limited privileges has been created. Previously,  the Admin was not accessible. Instead, users with these permissions were redirected to the storefront with a 404 error. _Fix submitted by Eden Duong in pull request [25909](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25909)_. [GitHub-25881](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25881)

<!--- ENGCOM-6785-->

*  Magento no longer duplicates SEO data such as URL key, meta title, meta keywords, and  meta description when you duplicate a product.  _Fix submitted by Dasharth patel in pull request [26659](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26659)_. [GitHub-26054](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26054)

<!--- ENGCOM-6442-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when you delete an image from a page while creating it from **Admin**  > **Content** > **Pages**  >  **Add New Page**. Previously, Magento threw this error in the developer console: `500 (Internal Server Error)`. _Fix submitted by Eden Duong in pull request [25924](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25924)_. [GitHub-25893](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25893)

### Bundle products

<!--- MC-25251-->

*  The performance of the `catalog_product_price` re-index operation for bundle products has been improved.

<!--- MC-29633-->

*  Administrators can no longer manually enter a tax class in the Admin for a bundle product when the bundle product’s **Tax Class** and **Dynamic Price** settings are disabled for the default store view.

<!--- MC-30257-->

*  Bundle product prices are now calculated correctly on product pages.

<!--- MC-29745-->

*  You can now add any number of bundle products to your shopping cart without error. Previously, when you added a bundle product to your cart, then navigated to the cart, Magento displayed this error: `Please correct the quantity for some products`.

<!--- ENGCOM-7114-->

*  The `cache.xsd` schema  from `Magento\Framework\Cache` has been refactored so that a cache type without an `instance` attribute no longer cause exceptions when you disable a module through the Admin cache management.

<!--- MC-23870-->

<!--- MC-32962-->

<!--- ENGCOM-7485-->

*  `StorefrontMiniCartSection`  has been replaced by`StorefrontMinicartSection` in MFTF tests.   _Fix submitted by Andrii Kalinich in pull request [27955](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27955)_. [GitHub-27897](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27897)

### Catalog

<!--- MC-23633-->

*  Magento now disables the ability of a restricted administrator to change a product’s quantity attribute and disables advanced inventory as expected. Previously, only the visual display of the quantity attribute was affected, and Magento changed the quantity value in the database after the product was saved.

<!--- MC-25235-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when you change the name of a tiered product that is included in a scheduled update. Previously, when you tried to save the product with a new name, Magento displayed this error: `SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1062 Duplicate entry '3-0-0-2.0000-0' for key 'UNQ_EBC6A54F44DFA66FA9024CAD97FED6C7', query was: INSERT INTO catalog_product_entity_tier_price (all_groups, customer_group_id, qty, value, website_id, percentage_value, row_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)`

<!--- MC-29023-->

*  Custom attribute values can now be saved as expected from the Admin.

<!--- MC-29775-->

*  The Recently View Products feature now shows products that are associated only with the current store view in multi-store deployments when **Stores** > **Configurations** > **Catalog** > **Recently Viewed/Compared Products** > **Show for Current** is set to **store view**. Previously, Magento displayed recently viewed products from all websites, no matter which website the product was assigned to.

<!--- MC-29896-->

*  Magento now displays product images in the mini cart without distortion. Previously, Magento stretched the image in the mini cart to fill the entire width and height of the image container.

<!--- MC-29866-->

*  The `getBasePrice` function now returns a float value as expected rather than a string.

<!--- MC-30229-->

*  The product compare feature now works as expected. It now displays only products in the current user’s compare list.

<!--- MC-30234-->

*  You can now assign a default watermark to a theme. Previously, after assigning the watermark, Magento threw a fatal error.

<!--- MC-30540-->

*  You can now successfully edit a configurable product with many variants (approximately 5,000) from the Admin. Previously, when you tried to edit a configurable product with many subproducts, Magento displayed this error: `Warning: DOMDocumentFragment::appendXML(): Entity: line 1: parser error : CData section too big found in /vendor/magento/framework/View/TemplateEngine/Xhtml/Template.php on line 60`

<!--- MC-30734-->

Previously, the checkbox for the non-default website was not preselected, and if the administrator left the checkbox unselected, Magento displayed an error message.

<!--- MC-32772-->

*  `addToCart` events are now tracked as expected in the data layer. Previously, after changing the configurable options for a product, then clicking **Add to cart**, the new `addToCart` event was not added to the data layer.

<!--- MC-29449-->

*  The mini cart and Admin shopping cart (**Admin** > **Customers** > **Manage Shopping Cart**) now display correct product prices when a Catalog Price Rule is applied. Previously, the storefront shopping cart displayed the correct product price, but the mini cart and Admin shopping cart displayed the original product price.

<!--- MC-30777-->

*  Filtering on the Admin product grid website column now works as expected. Previously, filter results did not display the correct number of products, but consistently displayed the total number of products as 1.

<!--- MC-31432-->

*  Price condition uses `catalog_product_entity_decimal` to filter by price. However, this table contains no records for configurable, bundle dynamic, and grouped products because these products have no fixed price. The correct table to use for filtering by price is `catalog_product_index_price`.

<!--- ENGCOM-7104-->

*  The Admin catalog and product lists now display currency symbols in the MSRP, Cost, and Special Price columns. _Fix submitted by Sergiy Vasiutynskyi in pull request [27261](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27261)_.

[GitHub-25911](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25911)

<!--- ENGCOM-6455-->

*  You can now navigate through multi-page category search results. Previously, Magento created duplicate pages of search results when you tried to use the Back button to return to the first page of results. _Fix submitted by Douglas Radburn in pull request [25337](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25337)_.

<!--- ENGCOM-6625-->

*  Saving a new (duplicated) product no longer results in the duplication of the product’s images hundreds of times. _Fix submitted by Jeroen in pull request [25875](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25875)_. [GitHub-9466](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9466)

<!--- ENGCOM-6959-->

*  Creating a product with no image by using `product_page_image_large` in your layout results in a placeholder image being displayed as expected.

<!--- ENGCOM-6983-->

*  You can use the `POST /V1/:sku/links` endpoint to set product links with an empty array of products when the product has existing links. Previously, Magento threw an error. _Fix submitted by Sathish Subramanian in pull request [26979](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26979)_. [GitHub-26800](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26800)

<!--- ENGCOM-7151-->

*  You can now use the Actions dropdown menu from the Products grid to specify whether a product has weight when you update multiple products’s attributes from the Admin.  _Fix submitted by Bartomiej Szubert in pull request [26075](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26075)_. [GitHub-6310](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/6310)

<!--- ENGCOM-7453-->

*  Validation logic has been added to the **Products per Page on Grid Allowed Values** and **Products per Page on Grid Default Value** fields of the store configuration page. Previously, store administrators could enter unavailable values in these fields.  _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [27093](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27093)_. [GitHub-27089](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27089)_

### Catalog widget

<!--- MC-29167-->

*  The `CatalogWidget` products list now works as expected with anchor categories, and products from anchor categories are now matched and displayed. Previously, when you selected a parent category that was an anchor, but that did not contain assigned products, products were not visible in the widget.

<!--- MC-30260-->

*  Magento now displays all children of a selected parent category as expected. Previously, if you selected a parent category that was an anchor, but that did not contain assigned products, Magento did not display all nested products.

<!--- MC-31171-->

*  The Recently Viewed Products widget now works correctly when **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Catalog** > **Catalog** > **Recently Viewed/Compared** > **Synchronize widget products with backend storage** is set to **Yes**.

<!--- MC-32452-->

*  New CMS pages are now added as expected to a website’s store page hierarchy.

<!--- ENGCOM-6483-->

<!--- ENGCOM-6992-->

*  The logic that is responsible  for updating configurable product product images has been improved. Previously,  simple products associated with a configurable product displayed only the default image associated with the configurable product, and  Magento sometimes displayed the wrong main image for the product. _Fix submitted by Sergiy Vasiutynskyi in pull request [26560](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26560)_. [GitHub-26473](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26473), [GitHub-26856](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26856), [GitHub-26858](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26858)

*  Metadata has been added to the `setRedirectCookie` and `clearRedirectCookie` functions.  _Fix submitted by Alexander Lukyanov in pull request [24612](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/24612)_. [GitHub-24547](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24547)

### Custom customer attributes

<!--- MC-30739-->

*  Magento now displays custom customer address attribute values as expected in the address section of the checkout workflow. Previously, Magento displayed the custom customer address attribute code instead of the value, and a JavaScript error was triggered.

<!--- MC-32301-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when you include an empty customer attribute field in the **Forms to Use In** field while creating a Company account on the storefront. Previously, Magento threw this error: `PHP Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: Argument 2 passed to Magento\Eav\Model\Attribute\Data\Text::validateLength() must be of the type string, null given`.

<!--- MC-33361-->

*  Magento now saves custom customer address attributes and implements them in registration forms as expected. Previously, when you created a new custom customer address attribute while creating an account from the cart, Magento did not save the attribute information.

### Customer

<!--- MC-29102-->

*  Customers who are subscribed to newsletters as a guest are no longer unsubscribed after registering for a new account.

<!--- MC-29841-->

*  Magento now uses a new `PHPSession` for each change of password.

<!--- MC-30650-->

*  You can now successfully create a customer and associate it with a particular website using the Associate to Website dropdown menu on **Customers** > **All Customers** > **Add new Customer**. Previously, when you tried to associate a new customer with the non-default website in a multi-site deployment, Magento displayed this error: `The store view is not in the associated website`.

<!--- MC-29946-->

*  Magento now saves the information a customer enters in the default billing and shipping fields during checkout when the transaction is initially declined due to an invalid credit card but later completed successfully. Previously, although Magento created the order when the customer entered valid payment information, it did not update the default billing or shipping addresses in the My Account section of the checkout workflow.

<!--- MC-32325-->

*  Magento now honors customer group settings when you create a new customer from the Admin in a multi-site deployment.

<!--- MC-31481-->

*  Magento now successfully imports customer data using the **Customer and Addresses (single file)** option when `cron` is enabled and the Customer Grid indexer is set to **Update By Schedule**. After `cron` executes, the imported customer information is available in the Admin as expected. Previously, Magento imported the customer data, but did not update the customer grid with the newly imported customer records.

<!--- MC-31117-->

*  You can now create a new customer from the storefront when the date of birth is required. Previously, you could not create a new customer when this field was required, even when you entered valid DOB values. [GitHub-26700](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26700)

<!--- MC-31945-->

*  Customer creation from the Admin now honors the default customer group setting as expected.

<!--- MC-31435-->

*  The `PHPSessionId` is now changed as expected after a customer logs out and then logs back in.

<!--- MC-32152-->

*  The Admin view of a customer cart now displays all the products that were added to the cart from multiple websites in a multi-website deployment. Previously, when a customer added a product to their cart from a non-default website, the product was not displayed in the Admin even when **Share customer account** is set to **Global**.

<!--- ENGCOM-7036-->

*  Validation now works as expected for the **Date of birth** field when editing a customer from the Admin. Previously, Magento did not factor in the user locale, and for some birthdates displayed this error: `The Date of Birth should not be greater than today`.   _Fix submitted by Sergiy Vasiutynskyi in pull request [27149](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27149)_. [GitHub-27027](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27027)

<!--- ENGCOM-6208-->

*  The email field is no longer required when placing an order from the Admin.  _Fix submitted by solwininfotech in pull request [24479](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/24479)_. [GitHub-22251](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22251)

<!--- ENGCOM-6667-->

*  Magento now displays only the products that the customer has placed in their cart when the cart is viewed from the Admin. Previously, a customer’s shopping cart displayed all the products in the catalog when viewed from the Admin. _Fix submitted by Ravinder in pull request [26489](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26489)_. [GitHub-26437](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26437)

<!--- ENGCOM-6423-->

*  The My Account dashboard now displays the displays email address values correctly in mobile view. _Fix submitted by Eden Duong in pull request [25942](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25942)_. [GitHub-25935](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25935)

<!--- ENGCOM-7034-->

*  Clicking the **Create an Account** button on the customer registration form multiple times no longer submits the registration request more than once. _Fix submitted by princeCB in pull request [26642](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26642)_. [GitHub-26590](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26590)

### Customer segment

<!--- MC-29471-->

*  Magento no longer removes your customer account from a customer segment when you log in as a user that is assigned to the customer segment when the segment includes a condition for past orders. Previously, you had to click **Refresh Segment Data** after logging in before Magento displayed your account in the Matched Customers list.

<!--- MC-30466-->

*  Customer segments now work as expected when segment conditions include the total number of orders.

<!--- MC-32409-->

*  Customer segment rules are now applied as expected when customer accounts are set up to be shared globally.

<!--- MC-33081-->

*  We’ve improved the performance of editing and saving customer segments that contain large numbers of customers (more than three million). Previously, when you created or edited a customer segment that contained many customers, Magento threw a 500 error.

### Directory

<!--- MC-33168-->

*  The Default State dropdown menu is now populated by data that is based on the allowed countries that have been assigned to the selected website when you configure a value for the **Default Tax Destination Calculation** field. Previously, this dropdown listed the countries that were assigned to the default website.

### Downloadable

<!--- MC-32306-->

*  You can now use an import file to update downloadable products in bulk by SKU and description. Previously, validation errors occurred, and import failed.

### Dynamic block (formerly banner)

<!--- MC-23852 31632-->

*  Dynamic blocks now work with customer segments as expected. Magento no longer displays a dynamic block when the condition that should trigger it is not fulfilled. Previously, Magento displayed a dynamic block for users logged in as a guest when the shopping cart was empty.

<!--- MC-32652-->

*  Dynamic blocks are now rendered on the storefront based on customer segment and store view.

### EAV

<!--- MC-29999-->

*  Magento now respects store-specific settings that determine whether the telephone number field of the checkout workflow is required in a multi-site deployment. Previously, in deployments where one store required this field in the checkout workflow and another store did not, customers who did not complete this field while checking out on the store that did not require it encountered this error: `Please check the shipping address information. "telephone" is required. Enter and try again`.

<!--- ENGCOM-6489-->

*  EAV sort order by `attribute option_id` now works as expected. _Fix submitted by Tan Sezer in pull request [24360](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/24360)_. [GitHub-24357](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24357)

<!--- ENGCOM-7082-->

*  You can now create a new product after adding a new attribute via REST and assigning it to an attribute set from the Admin. Previously, Magento threw a 500 error.  _Fix submitted by Sergiy Vasiutynskyi in pull request [27191](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27191)_. [GitHub-26827](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26827)

### Email

<!--- MC-32842-->

*  The authorization emails that are sent to a customer when they request a return now contain the RMA status as expected. Previously, this email displayed an empty string instead of the expected return status.

<!--- MC-32864-->

*  Customers are no longer redirected away from the current website when they report a forgotten password in multi-site deployments where customer accounts are shared globally. Previously, customers were redirected to the website on which the account was created.

<!--- MC-31544-->

*  Order confirmation emails that are sent to customers now include the list of ordered items as expected. Previously, when you created an email template in the Admin by loading and saving the default template, emails generated from this template did not include the list of ordered items. [GitHub-26882](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26882)

### Frameworks

*  Dependencies on Zend Framework have been migrated to the [Laminas project](https://getlaminas.org/about/foundation) to reflect the transitioning of Zend Framework to the Linux Foundation’s Laminas Project. Zend Framework has been deprecated. _Fix submitted by Ihor Sviziev in pull request [26436](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26436)_. [GitHub-26335](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26335)

<!--- MC-25257-->

*  Special price range settings (from/to dates) now work correctly for administrator accounts using a Dutch locale.

<!--- MC-29388-->

*  `php bin/magento cron:run` no longer processes items from the change log table multiple times. Previously, when you had more than 100000 new versions in the change log table, actions could be called several times for the same `entity id`.

*  The `php bin/magento setup:cron:run` command has now been removed. Also, remove references to this file in crontabs when upgrading.

*  The `update/cron.php` file has been removed in Magento 2.4.0, if this file exists on your installation, it can be safely removed. Also, remove references to this file in crontabs when upgrading.

<!--- MC-30544-->

*  The Update Attribute action now correctly updates the timestamp of a product’s `updated_at column` from `catalog_product_entity` when you update the product from the Admin edit product page.

<!--- MC-30834-->

*  Setting `'persistent' => '1'` in `env.php` no longer throws an error when you run `setup:upgrade`.

<!--- MC-32243-->

*  The **Invalid Form Key. Please refresh the page** text string on the login page is now translated as expected.

<!--- MC-33278-->

*  We’ve improved the performance of the `Magento\Framework\App\DeploymentConfig\Reader::load` function. Previously, when a request was made to Magento, this function was called repetitively, which resulted in `config.php` and `env.php config` files being loaded each time the method was called.

<!--- MC-31728-->

*  Magento no longer downloads a `blank.html` page when an administrator clicks on a product while creating an order from the Admin.

<!--- MC-31729-->

*  Non-cacheable blocks added to the default layout in reference instructions for non-existent (undeclared) components on the page no longer affect page caching. Adding non-cacheable blocks to default layout handlers renders all Magento pages non-cacheable. This results from the layout generation process: During layout generation, Magento collects all available layout handles for a particular page and merges instructions from them into the page’s final layout structure. The default layout handle is used as a basic handle for every page. As a result, layout updates that are declared for the default handler appear on every Magento page. [GitHub-9041](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9041)

<!--- MC-31920-->

*  The MySQL lock manager is now the primary lock manager. As a result,  the minimal required version of MySQL is 5.7.9.

<!--- ENGCOM-6431-->

*  `queue_consumer.xml` now allows numbers in the `handler` class. Previously, when  a handler contained a number in its path,  XSD validation failed. _Fix submitted by Eden Duong in pull request [25952](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25952)_. [GitHub-25731](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25731)

<!--- ENGCOM-6902-->

*  An incorrect `@var` reference in the `doc` block of the class member variable `$queueIterator` in class `\Magento\Framework\MessageQueue\Topology\Config` has been corrected. _Fix submitted by Artem Voloznov in pull request [24976](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/24976)_. [GitHub-24971](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24971)

<!-- ENGCOM-5305 6684-->

*  JavaScript page load listeners are now triggered to fire when a document is no longer `loading` rather than waiting until it is marked as `complete` as waiting until the document is marked as `complete` can lead to severe delays in rendering JavaScript content. _Fix submitted by John Hughes in pull request [23313](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/23313) and  pull request [50](https://github.com/magento/partners-magento2ee/pull/50)_. [GitHub-22909](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22909)

<!--- ENGCOM-6305-->

*  Magento now displays the following informative message when you try to add a product to your wishlist with a quantity of 0 or negative number: `Please enter a valid number in this field`. Previously, Magento displayed this error: `We can't update your Wish List right now`. _Fix submitted by Pawe Tylek in pull request [25641](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25641)_. [GitHub-25032](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25032)

<!-- ENGCOM-7071-->

*  Magento no longer supports inheritance of DTO classes from the `Magento\Framework\Api\AbstractExtensibleObject` class. Missing PHP annotation `@api`  has been added to `AbstractExtensibleModel`, and the missing `@deprecated`  annotation has been added to `AbstractExtensibleObject`.  _Fix submitted by Alexander Taranovsky in pull request [22011](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22011)_. [GitHub-22010](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22010)

<!--- ENGCOM-6552-->

*  You can now save products as expected after changing a product-related date (for example, `news_from_date`, `news_to_date`, `special_price_from_date`, `special_price_to_date`)  in stores implementing non-English locales. Previously, Magento threw an error similar to this:  `Invalid input datetime format of value '22/5/2019`.

### General fixes

<!--- MC-21347-->

*  The Customer module no longer has a dependency on the Review module. Previously, you could not disable the Review module due to this dependency.

<!--- MC-25250-->

*  The product edit page now loads successfully when the default attribute set for the page contains a dropdown attribute with the select label.

<!--- MC-25260-->

*  The graphical orders chart accessible from the Orders tab on the Admin now accurately reflects order quantity.

<!--- MC-29273-->

<!--- MC-30636-->

*  The TinyMCE4 editor now supports all HTML tags.

<!--- MC-31128-->

*  Clicking the **Refund Offline** button in the create a credit memo workflow now generates a credit memo as expected. Previously, a JavaScript error disabled this button, and Magento did not create a credit memo.

<!--- MC-31832-->

*  Merchants can now create a product attribute of type `Decimal`. Previously, due an earlier bug fix, Magento did not display the product attribute type `Price`. [GitHub-26949](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26949)

<!--- MC-32175-->

*  Magento no longer returns a 500 error when you try to open a Category page on the storefront when **Layout = Product – Full Width** has been set from the Design tab of the Category page.

<!--- MC-32697-->

*  Corrected a bug in `AbstractSimpleObjectBuilder.php`.

<!--- MC-33427-->

*  MAP (minimum advertised price) now works as expected for group products.

<!--- MC-29998-->

*  Magento now redirects you to the home page of the appropriate store view when you change language on CMS pages in a multi-store deployment. Previously, Magento displayed a 404 page when you changed language on certain CMS pages.

<!--- MC-30162-->

*  Order queries (`SalesOrderIndexGridAsyncInsertCron`) have been refactored to reduce the size of the data set returned and the frequency of the queries.

<!--- MC-32371-->

*  You can now successfully create a CMS page and assign it to the website root category in the CMS hierarchy.

<!--- MC-32783-->

*  Guests can now display a product price or add a product to the cart when category permissions are enabled (for example, when the **Not logged in** customer group has been granted these privileges).

<!--- MC-32815-->

*  Product rules now apply to out-of-stock products as expected. Previously, Magento did not display out-of-stock products in the related products list even when the rule was configured to display out-of-stock products.

<!--- MC-33222-->

*  Clicking the **Track shipping** button for an order from the Admin now results in tracking information being displayed in a pop-up window as expected. Previously, this link took the administrator to the Log in page.

<!--- MC-31305-->

*  Magento now displays an informative error message and continues to display the registration form as expected if an error occurs when a customer tries to complete a registration form that contains a multi-select customer attribute. Previously, Magento displayed a 500 error.

<!--- MC-32224-->

*  Magento now displays the **Credit memo** button after the partial refund of an order. Previously, Magento did not display this button after you created a partial refund, and you could not create a credit memo for the rest of the order.

<!--- MC-31878-->

*  Bulk order updates through REST now modify the order status as expected. Previously, Magento threw this error: `report.ERROR: Property "AdditionalInformation" does not have accessor method "setAdditionalInformation" in class "Magento\Sales\Api\Data\OrderPaymentInterface".`

<!--- MC-30398-->

*  Attribute filters are now displayed as expected in the Shopping Options block of the Category page.

<!--- MC-25138-->

*  You can now change the product limit on the Category page from 24 to 36 in deployments where B2B is installed. Previously, Magento threw a fatal error when this product limit was increased to 36.

<!--- ENGCOM-7175-->

*  Customer billing and shipping addresses are now displayed as expected under the Addresses tab on the Admin Customer Edit page when displayed in Internet Explorer. _Fix submitted by Vasilii Burlacu in pull request [27383](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27383)_. [GitHub-27370](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27370)

<!--- ENGCOM-6546-->

*  All bookmark views now remain editable when you delete one. Previously, all bookmark views became uneditable after you deleted the first view for accounts with multiple bookmark views. _Fix submitted by Bartomiej Szubert in pull request [26263](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26263)_. [GitHub-14913](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14913)

<!--- ENGCOM-7042-->

*  Layered navigation no longer breaks HTML5 validation of the swatch module. Previously, HTML validation errors occurred for attributes that were not defined in the [W3C markup validation service](http://validator.w3.org/), but those attributes have been changed to data attributes. _Fix submitted by Nirav Patel in pull request [26055](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26055)_. [GitHub-22363](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22363)

<!--- ENGCOM-6242-->

*  Magento now implements PHP7.x’s [throwable interface](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.throwable.php) to enable the catching of all errors that might potentially expose sensitive information such as passwords. _Fix submitted by miszyman in pull request [25250](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25250)_.

*  Pressing the ESC key when entering the name of a new folder on the create a new folder popup window now closes the popup as expected without creating the folder.  _Fix submitted by Shankar Konar in pull request [25349](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25349)_. [GitHub-572](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/572)

<!--- ENGCOM-7464-->

*  An incorrectly nested HTML structure has been corrected. Previously, this structure resulted in a broken layout for the list of related, up-sell, or cross-sell products. _Fix submitted by Pieter Hoste in pull request [27926](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27926)_. [GitHub-27920](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27920)

<!--- ENGCOM-7144-->

*  Removed duplicated call to `addToolbarBlock`, which had resulted in two similar conditions in `ORDER BY`.  _Fix submitted by Vasilii Burlacu in pull request [27263](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27263)_. [GitHub-26708](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26708)

<!--- ENGCOM-7071-->

*  We’ve added the `@api`  PHP annotation to `AbstractExtensibleModel`, the `@deprecated` PHP annotation to `AbstractExtensibleObject`, and `@see` to `AbstractExtensibleModel`.  _Fix submitted by Alexander Taranovsky in pull request [22011](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22011)_. [GitHub-22010](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22010)

### Gift cards

<!--- MC-31041-->

*  The GET `V1/orders/:orderId` call returns gift card codes as expected.

### Gift wrapping

<!--- MC-29893-->

*  Gift wrapping can now be added to the cart when it is enabled on the product level. Previously, you could add gift wrapping to a product on the storefront, but Magento would not include gift wrapping in the order summary.

<!--- MC-30543-->

*  An expired gift card becomes active as expected when you change its expiration date to a future date. Previously, the gift card remained expired.

<!--- MC-32551-->

*  The Admin Create Order page now loads correctly when the **Allow Gift Messages on Order Level** setting and template minification are enabled. Previously, when you tried to open this page when these settings were enabled, Magento threw this error: `Warning: require(content.phtml): failed to open stream: No such file or directory`.

<!--- MC-31427-->

*  Magento now correctly calculates the cost of gift wrapping based on the number of products for which you’ve ordered gift wrap. Previously, Magento included the cost of gift wrap for one product only in the order.

### Google Tag Manager

<!--- MC-29878-->

*  Merchants can now postpone sending data to Google Analytics until specified conditions are met.

<!--- MC-30673-->

*  The missing `Magento_GoogleTagManager::checkout/set_checkout_option.phtml` template has been restored.

### GraphQL

<!--- ENGCOM-7074-->

*  Magento now returns the GraphQL message `The cart isn't active` instead of `Current user does not have an active cart` under certain circumstances when a cart becomes inactive and a new cart ID is created. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [27187](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27187)_. [GitHub-26117](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26117)

<!--- ENGCOM-7105-->

*  Removed code that caused an error when using GraphQL to add products to a cart when a previously added product became out-of-stock. _Fix submitted by AleksLi in pull request [27015](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27015)_. [GitHub-26683](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26683)

<!--- ENGCOM-6535-->

*  Corrected a problem in GraphQL in which Magento did not return all the required information while using fragments on products query. _Fix submitted by Riccardo Tempesta in pull request [26218](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26218)_. [GitHub-26217](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26217)

*  The GraphQL mutation `setShippingMethodsOnCart` no longer retrieves the wrong data in the  `available_shipping_methods` attribute. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [27004](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27004)_. [GitHub-26742](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26742)

### Grouped products

<!--- ENGCOM-6115-->

*  You can now add a simple product that belongs to a group product to the shopping cart when another simple product that belongs to that same group is out-of-stock.  _Fix submitted by Gihovani Filipp Pereira Dem̩trio in pull request [24955](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/24955)_. [GitHub-22304](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22304)

<!--- ENGCOM-6768-->

*  Magento now sends email to customers about refunded group products as expected.  _Fix submitted by Alexander Taranovsky in pull request [26246](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26246)_. [GitHub-26245](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26245)

<!--- MC-30313-->

*  You can now add a child product of a grouped product to your cart when one of the grouped product’s other child products is out-of-stock. Previously, when one child product was out-of-stock, you could not add any other child products to the cart.

### Images

<!--- MC-29523-->

*  Images are now saved in `pub/media/catalog/category` as expected when you save category images. Previously, Magento saved these images in `pub/media/catalog/tmp/category`.

<!--- MC-30320-->

*  Watermark images no longer obscure the product image that they overlay. Previously, when the watermark image was larger than the product image it was applied to, the product image was not visible.

<!--- MC-32273-->

*  You can now successfully save an image to a category from the Admin. Previously, after you saved the image, part of  the URL was missing, and you couldn’t re-open the image.

<!--- MC-31727-->

*  Magento now displays `.png` images as expected after upload.

<!--- MC-29483-->

*  Images that have been uploaded into a CMS block using Page Builder are now displayed in the preview as expected when uploaded from an Admin that has a base URL that differs from the storefront URL.

<!--- ENGCOM-7063-->

*  Using REST to add or update an image now creates an image thumbnail as expected. _Fix submitted by Sergiy Vasiutynskyi in pull request [27170](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27170)_. [GitHub-26825](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26825)

*  Custom attributes of images generated by `Block\Product\ImageFactory` now render correctly. Previously, you could not add your own custom attributes to the attribute markup due to incorrect escaping of the HTML output. _Fix submitted by alexander-aleman in pull request [26959](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26959)_. [GitHub-25219](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25219)

<!--- ENGCOM-5980-->

*  Images are no longer blurred when a storefront is viewed from an iPhone.  _Fix submitted by Dmitriy in pull request [24743](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/24743)_. [GitHub-24735](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24735)

<!--- ENGCOM-6999-->

*  Images on the storefront are now responsive. Previously, image height was distorted.  _Fix submitted by Sean van Zuidam in pull request [27041](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27041)_. [GitHub-27040](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27040)

<!--- ENGCOM-7253-->

*  The default store logo is now visible on the storefront when the `Magento_blank` theme is used. _Fix submitted by Vasilii Burlacu in pull request [27497](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27497)_. [GitHub-27496](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27496)

### Import/export

<!--- MC-25206-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error during import when imported data includes a `swatch_image` store-view key has a value of `no_selection`. Previously, Magento threw this error: `Imported resource (image) could not be downloaded from external resource due to timeout or access permissions in row(s): 1`. [GitHub-25026](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25026)

<!--- MC-29417-->

*  Magento now updates images as expected when you use the `hide_from_product_page` setting when importing products in deployments with multiple store views.

<!--- MC-29677-->

*  Customizable options are now imported as expected when `row_id` is not equal to a product's `entity_id`. Previously, Magento did not import customizable options when `row_id` was not equal to a product’s `entity_id`, which resulted in certain products not being imported.

<!--- MC-29916-->

*  Images associated with configurable products are now properly uploaded during import and available for viewing as expected from the product edit page.

<!--- MC-30304-->

*  Exported `.csv` files now reflect filter settings for including in-stock or out-of-stock products. Previously, Magento exported all products, no matter which stock setting you selected.

<!--- MC-30323-->

*  You can now successfully import or update customers using the Customer and addresses single file option of the import workflow. Previously, when you selected this option, Magento did not import the customer data and displayed this error: `Invalid data for insert`.

<!--- MC-30357-->

*  The Stock Indexer is now triggered as expected after import and updates product status. Previously, the Stock Indexer did not index the changed product inventory data.

<!--- MC-30528-->

*  Magento now successfully imports all custom options for a configurable product’s child products when `store_view_code` is specified. This works whether you choose to import configurable products individually or collectively. Previously, Magento did not successfully import all custom options when the import file contained more than one item and `store_view_code` was specified.

<!--- MC-30672-->

*  Magento now provides a message during product import that identifies which products in the imported `.csv` file have duplicated keys. Merchants can use this information to resolve conflicts. Previously, Magento displayed this error: `Notice: Undefined index: name in /var/www/html/ee233dev/app/code/Magento/CatalogImportExport/Model/Import/Product.php on line 2524`

<!--- MC-29960-->

*  Magento now displays a more informative error message, and does not display a download link, when you try to delete a directory from the **System** > **Export** list. Previously, when you tried to delete a directory from this list, Magento continued to display a download link for files that could not be downloaded, and displayed an uninformative error message.

<!--- MC-29959-->

*  The `.csv` file that is used during import now contains the correct links for downloadable products and is now correctly formatted to support importing and updating downloadable products.

<!--- MC-30189-->

*  Magento now successfully exports a `.csv` file when you set import behavior for Replace, select a previously exported `.csv` file, and click **Check data**. Previously, Magento displayed this error: `Data validation failed. Please fix the following errors and upload the file again` and `Following Error(s) has been occurred during importing process`.

<!--- MC-30141-->

*  The Stock Indexer is now triggered as expected after import and updates product status. Previously, the Stock Indexer did not index the changed product inventory data.

<!--- MC-31198-->

*  `.csv` files that are generated during product import now contain group titles for downloadable products as expected. Previously, unnecessary validation of `group_title` during import prevented the display of group titles for downloadable products.

<!--- MC-32153-->

*  When `cron` is enabled and you perform a customer import using the **(Customer and Addresses (single file))** option, Magento populates data to the Admin customer grid as expected. The customer grid displays the customers once manual re-indexing completes for `customer_grid indexer`. Previously, Magento did not update the customer grid with newly imported customer addresses.

<!--- MC-32154-->

*  Magento now displays the customer list as expected after automatic re-indexing. Previously, although manually running `bin/magento index:reindex` worked, the customer grid did not display customer information after automatic re-indexing.

<!--- MC-30148-->

*  Magento now deletes temporary files from `<Magento_home>/var` as expected after product import has completed.

<!--- MC-31879-->

*  Magento no longer creates duplicate SKUs in the Admin when products are imported by `.csv` file.

<!--- ENGCOM-6141-->

*  Import no longer fails when the imported configurable attribute includes an equal sign (=) in its value. _Fix submitted by dhoang89 in pull request [25194](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25194)_. [GitHub-25188](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25188)

<!--- ENGCOM-6901-->

*  All exported grid data (both Magento and custom data) now have option labels instead of option values for all the columns with type `Select` or `Multiselect`. Previously, when you exported this data, the exported spreadsheet contained Columns with ID rather than the values that were displayed in the grid. _Fix submitted by Maksym Novik in pull request [26523](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26523)_. [GitHub-25963](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25963)

<!--- ENGCOM-7145-->

*  Magento now displays bundle products on the storefront as expected after you update a product by importing a `.csv` file. _Fix submitted by Pavel Bystritsky in pull request [25664](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25664)_. [GitHub-25540](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25540)

### Index

<!--- MC-25236 30779-->

*  We have improved the performance of `indexer_update_all_views`. Indexing is now faster, inactive rules are no longer processed, and caches are cleared of entries for only changed products.

<!--- MC-29917-->

*  Product prices on the storefront now accurately reflect the application of a scheduled Catalog Price Rule update. Previously, prices did not reflect the scheduled cart price rule until you manually re-indexed (`php bin/magento indexer:reindex catalogrule_rule`).

<!--- MC-30588-->

*  You can now successfully re-index the product database after adding an attribute that is unsearchable (that is, the `is_searchable`, `is_filterable`, `is_visible_in_advanced_search` attributes are disabled).

<!--- ENGCOM-6533-->

*  Magento now displays a message that identifies the indexer and the time the indexing operation took when a re-indexing operation fails. _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [26207](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26207)_. [GitHub-26206](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26206)

<!--- ENGCOM-7179-->

*  Products that are saved in stores where the  `onthefly` indexer and flat tables are enabled now respect website assignments. Previously, if you removed all website assignments from a product and then saved it,  all flat tables included the product, despite the specified website assignments.  _Fix submitted by Abel Truong in pull request [27365](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27365)_. [GitHub-16315](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/16315)

### Infrastructure

*  The Internet Explorer 11.x browser is no longer supported.

<!--- MC-32223-->

*  The validation logic that is associated with the **Date of Birth** field of the Customer Registration form no longer triggers a JavaScript error.

<!--- ENGCOM-7000-->

*  Added an integration test to cover `$storeId` for the  Category Repository `get()` method. _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [27048](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27048)_. [GitHub-27044](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27044)

<!--- ENGCOM-6378-->

*  Enabling the **Block all cookies** setting in Safari no longer results in JavaScript errors, and Magento displays the `cookies disabled` message as expected. Previously, Magento displayed multiple `SecurityError (DOM Exception 18): The operation is insecure` errors in the console. _Fix submitted by Ra̼l Verdugo Lorenzo in pull request [25324](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25324)_. [GitHub-13865](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13865)

<!--- ENGCOM-6674-->

*  Magento no longer throws this error when running integration tests: `Error: Call to a member function findFile() on array (/var/www/html/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/Code/Generator/DefinedClasses.php:59)`. Previously, an issue with `AutoloaderRegistry::getAutoloader` caused integration tests to fail randomly. _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [26480](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26480)_. [GitHub-26479](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26479)

<!--- ENGCOM-6958-->

*  The `date` tag in `/module-sales/view/frontend/templates/order/order_date.phtml`  has been corrected to `span`. Previously, Magento logged an error in the `exception.log` file when you clicked **View Order** on the storefront **My Account** > **My Orders** page. _Fix submitted by Andrii  Chorniy in pull request [25895](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25895)_. [GitHub-13269](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13269), [GitHub-25738](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25738)

<!--- ENGCOM-6316-->

*  The JavaScript mixin module has been refactored to improve the loading and application of mixins for advanced bundled modules. Previously,  Magento did not load or apply mixins  for advanced  bundled modules.  _Fix submitted by Mateusz Krzeszowiak in pull request [25587](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25587)_. [GitHub-25586](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25586)

<!--- ENGCOM-6344-->

*  The `grunt clean` command now cleans generated code and metadata folders as expected. _Fix submitted by Andrii Beziazychnyi in pull request [25765](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25765)_. [GitHub-25739](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25739)

<!-- ENGCOM-6463-->

*  `getVersion` result (`ProductMetadata::getVersion`) is now cached, which improves performance of the `ProductMetadata::getVersion` method.  _Fix submitted by Lukasz Lewandowski in pull request [26001](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26001)_. [GitHub-24025](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24025)

<!--- ENGCOM-7037-->

*  A missing setter for `additional_information` has been added to `OrderPaymentInterface`, which resolves an inconsistency between its schema declaration and accepted properties. _Fix submitted by Antonino Bonumore in pull request [26748](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26748)_. [GitHub-26745](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26745), [GitHub-13222](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13222)

### Layered navigation

<!--- MC-31763-->

*  Magento now renders the **Yes/No** attribute on the Category page when **Use in Layered Navigation: Filterable (with results)** for storefront properties is enabled.

<!-- ENGCOM-6807-->

*  Redundant `\Magento\Sales\Model\Order\Email\Sender\ShipmentSender` has been deprecated in favor of  `\Magento\Sales\Model\Order\Shipment\Sender\EmailSender`. _Fix submitted by Adarsh Manickam in pull request [26714](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26714)_. [GitHub-14885](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14885)

### Logging

<!--- MC-29636-->

*  Order status changes are now logged as expected under **System** > **Action Logs** > **Report**.

<!--- MC-29637-->

*  Magento now logs sales shipment actions in the Admin Action log as expected.

<!--- MC-29892-->

*  CMS page save actions are now logged in Admin Action Logs. Previously, only view actions were logged.

<!--- MC-30618-->

*  Save actions on CMS pages are now logged as expected in Admin action logs when **Select all actions to be logged** is enabled on the Admin Actions Logging tab (**Admin** > **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Advanced**).

<!--- ENGCOM-7274-->

*  CMS page modifications are now logged as expected in the Action log. MFTF now covers this feature.  _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [27597](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27597)_. [GitHub-171](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/171)

### Media Gallery

<!--- ENGCOM-6993-->

*  Clicking **Enter** after naming a new folder in the Media Gallery now saves all changes you’ve made. Previously, clicking **Enter** instead of using the mouse to select **OK** resulted in all changes being lost.  _Fix submitted by Sergiy Vasiutynskyi in pull request [27029](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27029)_. [GitHub-26847](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26847)

<!-- ENGCOM-7490-->

*  You can now create a subfolder under the Media Gallery that has the same name as the primary folder. Previously, you could not save the subfolder with the same name. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [27976](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27976)_. [GitHub-1270](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1270)

### Media Storage

<!--- MC-32593-->

*  `var/resource_config.json` is no longer regenerated whenever an image is requested by `get.php`. Previously, this file was rewritten on each call to `get.php`.

### New Relic

<!-- ENGCOM-6461-->

*  Magento `cron`job names are now included as expected within Transaction Traces in the NewRelic APM Monitoring - Transactions. This includes `cron` jobs that are executed from the command line as well as jobs executed by the standard scheduler.  _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [25957](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25957)_. [GitHub-22047](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22047)

### Newsletter

<!--- MC-31768-->

*  Customers can now subscribe as expected to newsletters. Previously, when a customer tried to confirm their subscription, Magento displayed this error: `This is an invalid subscription confirmation code`.

<!--- ENGCOM-6525-->

*  The newsletter input field of the storefront footer is now rendered identically by any supported browser.  _Fix submitted by divyajyothi5321 in pull request [26182](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26182)_. [GitHub-26176](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26176)

<!--- ENGCOM-6691-->

*  Storefront messages about newsletter subscriptions are now rendered as expected in HTML. _Fix submitted by Oleh Usik in pull request [26455](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26455)_. [GitHub-25162](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25162)

### Orders

<!--- MC-33456-->

*  Order summary subtotals no longer display excluded taxes when the website display settings specify that taxes should be excluded. Previously, when multiple websites were configured with different display settings, the setting defined in the server variable was used for the store despite the store-level configurations.

### Payment methods

<!--- MC--->

*  The integration of third-party payment methods Authorize.Net, eWay, CyberSource, Braintree, and Worldpay into the core Magento code have been removed. Merchants should migrate to the official extensions that are available on the Magento Marketplace.

<!--- MC--->

*  The core implementation of Signifyd fraud protection is no longer supported. Merchants should migrate to the [Signifyd Fraud & Chargeback Protection extension](https://marketplace.magento.com/signifyd-module-connect.html) that is available on Magento Marketplace.

<!--- MC-32546-->

*  You can now successfully complete an order and return to the merchant’s home page when **Website Payments Pro Hosted Solution** is configured. Previously, when you clicked **Return to merchant**, Magento threw this error: `Invalid Form Key. Please refresh the page`.

<!--- ENGCOM-6606-->

*  Switching billing address no longer causes JavaScript function text to render in the payment section of the storefront checkout workflow. _Fix submitted by Chris Pook in pull request [26378](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26378)_. [GitHub-26375](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26375)

<!--- ENGCOM-7223-->

*  Credit memos now display the correct amount in the **Adjustment Refund** field of the Credit Memo overview.  _Fix submitted by Sergiy Vasiutynskyi in pull request [27343](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27343)_. [GitHub-13851](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13851)

<!--- ENGCOM-6524-->

*  You can now remove additional information from the `quote_payment column additional_information` table after you’ve saved a quote. Previously, you could not remove this information after saving the quote because the `unsAdditionalInformation` method in `\Magento\Payment\Model\Info` did not initialize data properly.  _Fix submitted by Marco Oliveira in pull request [26084](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26084)_. [GitHub-26083](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26083)

<!--- ENGCOM-6609-->

*  Payment instructions are now derived from the store view from which an order was made. Previously, payment instructions were used from the default store view because the `BeforeOrderPaymentSaveObserver` method fetched payment instructions from the default store view. _Fix submitted by Karyna Tsymbal in pull request [26399](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26399)_. [GitHub-26332](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26332)

<!--- ENGCOM-6953-->

*  Magento now collects the payment information that is displayed on both the Admin and in invoice and shipment invoices from the store in which the order was made in deployments with multiple stores. Previously, Magento derived payment information from the default store.  _Fix submitted by Bartomiej Szubert in pull request [26765](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26765)_. [GitHub-17933](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/17933)

#### PayPal

<!--- MC-30498-->

*  Magento now displays an informative error message each time a customer clicks **Pay with PayPal** after entering an invalid shipping address in the checkout workflow. Previously, Magento displayed an error message only when the customer first clicked the button, not for subsequent clicks.

<!--- MC-30639-->

*  Magento no longer changes an order’s status to `Processing` in the Payment Review section of the checkout workflow when a payment with PayPal fails.

<!--- MC-30864-->

*  You can now successfully complete an order using the Payflow Link payment method. Previously, the Payflow Link payment method always rejected payment because the order status remained in the `Pending` payment state, even though the order status in the payment method logs was `Approved`.

<!--- MC-32494-->

*  Orders that are placed using PayPal Payflow Pro are now set to `Suspected Fraud` status when fraud filters are triggered.

<!--- MC-33110-->

*  You can now use PayPal Express Checkout with any supported credit card. Previously, when you clicked on a credit card button while using PayPal Express Checkout to complete an order, Magento hung, and you could not enter any credit card information.

<!--- MC-33117-->

*  Orders placed within PayPal Payflow Pro are now set to `Suspected Fraud` status when fraud filters are triggered. Previously, payment transaction status on PayPal was not validated before payment approval occurred on the Magento side.

<!--- MC-33294-->

*  Payflow Pro now works as expected when Website Restrictions are enabled.

<!--- MC-31196-->

*  Magento now successfully processes orders placed with PayPal Express Checkout where the order’s shipping address specifies a country region that the customer has manually entered into the text field rather than selected from the drop-down menu on the Shipping page. Previously, Magento displayed this error on the order review page: `Error 500: NOTICE: PHP message: PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to a member function getId() on null in httpdocs/vendor/magento/module-paypal/Model/Api/Nvp.php:1527`. [GitHub-26698](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26698)

<!--- MC-31573-->

*  The PayPal Pro payment method now works as expected in the Chrome 80 browser. This payment method previously invoked a Magento callback endpoint that needed access to the customer’s session — access that the new default Chrome SameSite cookie functionality does not permit. [GitHub-26840](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26840)

<!--- MC-31292-->

*  You can now successfully use PayPal Express to pay for an order when persistent checkout cart has been enabled and the **Clear Persistence on Sign Out** setting is set to **no**. Previously, Magento redirected you to the Login page.

<!--- ENGCOM-6383-->

*  Payments from Paypal Express and Web Payments Pro now move to the `Processing` state as expected once processing has begun. Previously, Paypal Web Payments Pro payments remained in the `Pending` payment state even when payment information was in the `Processing` state. _Fix submitted by azambon in pull request [25876](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25876)_. [GitHub-25659](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25659)

### Performance

<!--- MC-31499-->

*  Customer data section invalidation logic has been improved. This release introduces a new way of invalidating all customer sections data that avoids a known issue with local storage when custom `sections.xml` invalidations are active. (Previously, private content (local storage) was not correctly populated when you had a custom *etc/frontend/sections.xml* with action invalidations.) See [Private content](https://{{page.baseurl}}/guides/v2.3/extension-dev-guide/cache/page-caching/private-content.html#invalidate-private-content).

<!--- MC-31449-->

*  The import of customer accounts has been refactored to improve import speed.

<!--- MC-23383 ENGCOM-7006-->

*  Merchants can now use [lazy loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading) to load images. See [Configure theme properties](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/frontend-dev-guide/themes/theme-images.html). _Fix submitted by Timon de Groot in pull request [27033](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27033)_. [GitHub-27032](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27032)

<!--- ENGCOM-6988-->

*  Dashboard charts have been migrated to the `chart.js` library.  _Fix submitted by Bartomiej Szubert in pull request [26923](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26923). [GitHub-186](https://github.com/magento/community-features/issues/186)_

<!-- ENGCOM-6232-->

*  The performance of operations that are run on large catalogs that contain many product attributes (on the scale of 3,000 - 23000 options) has been improved by the refactoring of the how attribute option arrays are built. _Fix submitted by Behnam Shayani in pull request [25452](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25452)_. [GitHub-20966](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/20966)

### Pricing

<!--- ENGCOM-6647-->

*  Magento now saves and displays the correct price for tiered products even after you’ve edited products multiple times. Previously, Magento did not save the last edits made to product price. _Fix submitted by Ravi Chandra in pull request [26162](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26162)_. [GitHub-25195](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25195)

<!--- ENGCOM-6914-->

*  Both fixed and discount save percentage are now correctly applied on an order’s final price. Previously,  Magento displayed an incorrect tier price (both fixed & discount) save percentage on the product detail page. _Fix submitted by Sathish Subramanian in pull request [26584](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26584)_. [GitHub-26583](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26583)

### Product alert

<!--- MC-30255-->

*  The stock alert email sent to customers about the re-stocking of a configurable product now contains the correct product price. Previously, this email contained a product price of 0.

<!--- MC-32873-->

*  Product stock alert unsubscribe now works when a user’s session has expired. Previously, when you clicked on the **Click here to stop alerts for this product** link, Magento displayed a 404 error.

<!--- MC-31979-->

*  Unsubscribe actions for product alerts now work as expected. Previously, when a customer clicked on the **Click here to stop alerts for this product** link, Magento displayed a 404 error.

### Product video

<!--- MC-23743-->

*  You can now use REST to update YouTube videos (PUT `rest/V1/products/{SKU}`). Previously, Magento displayed a thumbnail for the video, but the video player did not load when you clicked the **Play** button. [GitHub-23194](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23194)

### Reports

<!--- ENGCOM-6635-->

*  Product lists now order configurable products by SKU, which groups configurable products by variations. Previously, the report grouped products by `product_id`. _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [25858](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25858)_. [GitHub-25856](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25856)

<!--- ENGCOM-6427-->

*  The **Admin** > **Reports** > **Refresh Statistics** table now displays **Updated At = Null** status as **Never** in the **Updated** column instead of **undefined**. _Fix submitted by Eden Duong in pull request [25932](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25932)_.

### Return Merchandise Authorizations (RMA)

<!--- MC-24906-->

<!--- MC-30181-->

*  Tracking links included in storefront order returns now work as expected. Previously, when a customer clicked the shipment tracking link on the order return page, Magento displayed this error: `PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to a member function getTitle() on null in /app/z7kvt3uys6daq/var/view_preprocessed/pub/static/vendor/magento/module-shipping/view/frontend/templates/tracking/details.phtml:1`.

<!--- MC-31293-->

<!--- MC-24023-->

*  Magento no longer displays an error when a customer adds a quantity of a product to their cart that exceeds half of the existing product stock but does not exceed the total stock.

<!--- ENGCOM-6910-->

*  You can now successfully add a product to the cart from the Admin when the stock quantity is 1.

### Sales Rule

<!--- MC-30155-->

<!--- MC-32229-->

<!--- ENGCOM-6824-->

*  Magento now correctly calculates cart-level fixed discounts using cart price rules when a configurable product is first added to the cart. _Fix submitted by Lachlan Turner in pull request [26623](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26623)_. [GitHub-26622](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26622)

### Search

*  Elasticsearch 7.6.x is now the default catalog search engine for Magento Commerce and Open Source. You cannot install or upgrade to Magento 2.4.0 without also installing Elasticsearch 7.6.x. Elasticsearch version 2.x code has been removed. Elasticsearch versions 5.x and 6.x have been deprecated and are no longer supported. See [Elasticsearch]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/prereq/elasticsearch.html).

<!--- MC-23753-->

*  Magento now renders the **<** and **>** symbols correctly in storefront catalog search strings.

<!--- MC-25010-->

<!--- MC-30201-->

*  Elasticsearch now correctly displays results from category pages when you change the number of search results viewed per page. Previously, when you changed how many search results should be displayed on the search results page, Magento displayed a blank page and this error: `"0":"SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near'`

<!--- MC-32430-->

<!--- ENGCOM-6364-->

*  The Elasticsearch versions are now identified by X.x notation instead of X.0+ notation in the Admin (**Stores** > Settings > **Configuration** > **Catalog** > **Catalog** > **Catalog Search**). _Fix submitted by Andreas Mautz in pull request [25838](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25838)_. [GitHub-25674](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25674)

### Shipping

<!--- MC-29276-->

*  Magento now applies fixed-amount, whole-cart discounts correctly for orders being shipped to multiple addresses. Previously, this type of discount was applied multiple times when a customer checked out an order using Check Out with Multiple Addresses. [GitHub-25834](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25834)

<!--- MC-29444-->

<!--- MC-31396-->

*  Free Shipping Price rules now affect only the relevant products when a shopping cart contains products from categories that are included by the Free Shipping Price rule as well as products from categories not included in the rule.

<!--- ENGCOM-6436-->

*  Magento no longer displays a blank page instead of displaying all the shipping carriers in the dropdown/multi-select box. Previously, an error in the `toOptionArray` function in `vendor/magento/module-shipping/Model/Config/Source/Allmethods.php` occurred. _Fix submitted by Marc Rodriguez in pull request [25315](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25315)_.

<!--- ENGCOM-6523-->

*  Plugins for `Magento\Ups\Model\Carrier` that implement custom `di.xml` now work properly in developer mode.

### Staging

<!--- MC-32342-->

*  Administrators with restricted access to one website only in a multi-site deployment can now preview a Scheduled Update for that website. Previously, the staging preview used the default store by default, and if the user did not have access to the default store, Magento threw an exception.

<!--- MC-32736-->

*  Editing an existing schedule no longer results in a duplicated schedule. Previously, when you edited an existing schedule, Magento duplicated it, and when you tried to open the duplicate schedule, Magento threw an error.

<!--- MC-32432-->

*  Cross-sell products are now displayed as expected on View and Edit Cart pages after creating a Schedule Update for one or more of these products.

### Store

<!--- MC-25187-->

*  Customer sessions now persist as expected when a customer logs in to one store, adds products to the shopping cart, and then switches to a new store in a multi-store deployment. Previously, when the customer navigated to the second store, Magento logged out the customer and emptied the shopping cart.

<!--- ENGCOM-4781-->

*  Magento now deletes records that are related to a deleted store view from the `sale_sequence_meta` and `sales_sequence_profile` tables as expected. _Fix submitted by Bartomiej Szubert in pull request [22296](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22296)_. [GitHub-14958](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14958)

<!--- ENGCOM-6869-->

*  Store switcher now works as expected when switching between stores that have different base URLs. Previously, when a customer used the store switcher to switch between stores,  the request failed if the target store had a different base URL than the current store. _Fix submitted by Tobias Nilsson in pull request [26548](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26548)_. [GitHub-23755](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23755), [GitHub-26384](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26384)

### Swatches

<!--- MC-30294-->

*  Merchants can now successfully add color swatch attributes to products using the **Visual Swatch** option on **Stores** > **Attributes** > **Product** > **New Attribute**. Previously, a JavaScript error was triggered when you tried to open the newly created swatch attribute.

<!--- ENGCOM-6750-->

*  The Minimum Advertised Price now changes as expected when a customer selects a new swatch option for a configurable product. _Fix submitted by Sergiy Vasiutynskyi in pull request [26241](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26241)_.

### TargetRule

<!--- MC-31546-->

*  The related product block that is displayed for a product on the storefront now displays the products that have met the criteria defined in the Related Product Rule. Previously, Magento did not display any related products.

### Tax

<!--- MC-29579-->

*  Magento now updates shipping rates and prices as expected when a customer changes the destination country for an order during checkout.

<!--- MC-30546-->

*  Free shipping is now applied as expected based on the applicable cart price rule. Previously, cart price rules did not take into account taxes when calculating whether an order meets criteria for free shipping.

<!--- MC-32402-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when you edit and save the `NOT LOGGED IN` customer group when B2B is installed.

### Test

### Theme

<!--- MC-29804-->

*  We’ve resolved a bug in `JsFooterPlugin.php` that affected the display of dynamic blocks. Previously, Magento displayed this error when you directly accessed `/banner/ajax/load/url`: `Uncaught TypeError: strpos() expects parameter 1 to be string, null given in`.

<!--- ENGCOM-6708-->

*  The `i18n` method provides the ability to add a string to underscore templates.  _Fix submitted by Sergiy Vasiutynskyi in pull request [26435](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26435)_. [GitHub-18012](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/18012)

### UI

<!--- MC-32547-->

<!--- ENGCOM-6482-->

*  Input that is validated by the JavaScript validator on the storefront will also pass validation on the Admin. Previously, the JavScript validator counted newlines as a single character on the storefront, but on the server side, `\Magento\Catalog\Model\Product\Option\Type\maxCharacters` counted newlines as two characters. _Fix submitted by Grzegorz Bogusz in pull request [26033](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26033)_.

<!--- ENGCOM-6997-->

Previously, in deployments with multiple store views, Magento sometimes generated incorrect URL rewrites by using the default value of the category url path instead of the storeview-specific URL path. _Fix submitted by Pieter Hoste in pull request [26784](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26784)_. [GitHub-25124](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25124), [GitHub-11616](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11616)

### Visual Merchandiser

<!--- MC-31136-->

*  The edit category page now behaves as expected when you drag and drop products to a new position. Previously, dragging and dropping products on any category page repositioned the viewing window at the top of the page.

[GitHub-13252](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/13252)

<!--- ENGCOM-6500-->

*  Updating customer information through `/V1/customers/:id` no longer resets the `group_id` unnecessarily. Previously, when you updated a customer through REST, the customer group was changed to 1 if the body did not contain a customer group. _Fix submitted by MaxRomanov4669 in pull request [25958](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25958)_. [GitHub-14663](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14663)

<!--- ENGCOM-7075-->

[GitHub-14086](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/14086)

<!--- ENGCOM-7011-->

*  The pagination of results from REST requests is now accurate. Previously, when you requested results from a specific page (for example, `page_size` = 1 and a `current_page` value that was out of scope), the call returned repeated the last page of results rather than an informative message .  _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [26988](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26988)_. [GitHub-26986](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26986), [GitHub-8099](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8099)

<!-- ENGCOM-6540-->

### Wishlist

<!--- MC-29988-->

<!--- MC-30196-->

*  Magento now correctly saves and displays a new name for a wishlist when you rename a wishlist in deployments that contain multiple wishlists. Previously, Magento continued to display the former wishlist name.

<!--- MC-31948-->

*  You can now navigate and modify wishlists from the cart in deployments running Internet Explorer 11.x. Previously, you could not create, edit, or move a wishlist in this environment.

<!--- ENGCOM-6518-->

*  We’ve improved the error message that is displayed when a customer tries to share their wishlist with more email addresses than is permitted.  _Fix submitted by divyajyothi5321 in pull request [26066](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26066)_. [GitHub-26064](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26064)

<!--- ENGCOM-6723-->

*  Magento now displays the My Wishlist page as expected in displays with resolution greater than  768px and less than 1023px. _Fix submitted by Hitesh in pull request [26546](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26546)_. [GitHub-26543](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26543)

<!--- ENGCOM-7062-->

[GitHub-11209](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11209)

### WYSIWYG

<!--- ENGCOM-6275-->

*  The WYSIWYG image uploader now uses `pub/media/wysiwyg` as the storage root. Previously, the uploaded used `pub/media` as its storage root, which made those uploaded images inaccessible after recent changes to image uploader code. _Fix submitted by Pieter Hoste in pull request [24878](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/24878)_. [GitHub-22609](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22609)

<!--- ENGCOM-7045-->

*  TinyMCE4 on the Chrome browser now handles double-byte characters as expected. Previously, TinyMCE4 could not properly handle double-byte characters (such as used in Chinese) on Chrome. _Fix submitted by Hirokazu Nishi in pull request [25454](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25454)_. [GitHub-24637](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24637)

## Known issues -- general

**Issue**: Anomalies in storefront error messages occur in deployments where PHP 7.4.2 is installed. When Magento 2.4.0 is deployed with PHP 7.4.2, the space symbols in storefront error messages are replaced with plus (+) characters.  This bug is native to PHP 7.4.2 and cannot be corrected by Magento. **Workaround**: Magento recommends using other versions of PHP 7.4.x. See [Raw message data display on storefront](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045804332)  Knowledge Base article. <!--- MC-34170-->

**Issue**: Merchants cannot add ordered products to a package from the Admin Create Package page and save the package. See [Shipping labels creation](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046750171) Knowledge Base article. The **MC-35514-2.4.0-CE-composer.patch** hotfix  for this issue is now available from [Releases](https://magento.com/tech-resources/download). <!--- MC-35514-->

**Issue**: Magento displays this error message during installation of Magento with third-party extensions that have dependencies on APIs for the `Store` module in CLI commands: `The default website isn't defined. Set the website and try again`. **Workaround**: Remove dependencies on third-party extensions from Composer, install Magento, and then install third-party extensions.

**Issue**: The **Add selections to my cart** button on the bottom of the shopping cart does not work. **Workaround**: Use the **Add selections to my cart** button on the top of the page. See [Add selections to my cart button does not work](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045838312) Knowledge Base article. <!--- MC-35313-->

**Issue**: Merchants cannot interact with any page elements on the Returns page after creating a shipping label for a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA). See [Returns Edit page stops working when creating shipping label](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046441312) Knowledge Base article. The **MC-35984-2.4.0-composer.patch** hotfix for this issue is now available from [Releases](https://magento.com/tech-resources/download). <!--- MC-35984-->

**Issue**: Administrators cannot add a configurable product by SKU to a quote. When an administrator clicks on the **Add to Quote** button,  the Quote Edit page remained in a loading state, and the administrator could not save their changes. **Workaround**:  There is no workaround for B2B Quote editing.  However, you can still order products by selecting the products from the products list instead of adding them by SKU. See B2B Admin cannot add a configurable product to a quote](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046801971) Knowledge Base article. <!--- MC-35513-->

### B2B

**Issue**: If a discount code expires before a Purchase Order (PO) is approved, the PO continues to display the discounted amount, but once the PO is approved, the order is placed at the non-discounted total. **Workaround**: Install the **B2B-709 Purchase Order Discount patch** hotfix for this issue, which is now available from the **My Account** > **Downloads** section of `magento.com`.
