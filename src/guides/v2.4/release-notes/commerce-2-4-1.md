title: Magento Commerce 2.4.1 Release Notes
---

Magento Commerce 2.4.1 introduces enhancements to performance and security plus significant additions to the B2B feature set. Security enhancements include support for the `SameSite` attribute for cookies and the addition of CAPTCHA protection for payment-related and order-related API endpoints and the Place Order storefront page. B2B improvements focus on the order approval process, B2B shipping methods, expanded logging of Admin actions, and enhanced security on storefront.

This release includes all improvements to core quality that were included in Magento 2.4.0, over 150 new fixes to core code, and over 15 security enhancements. It includes the resolution of almost 300 GitHub issues by our community members. These community contributions range from minor clean-up of core code to significant enhancements in GraphQL.

All known issues identified in Magento 2.4.0 have been fixed in this release.

Quarterly releases may contain backward-incompatible changes (BIC). Magento 2.4.1 contains minor backward-incompatible changes. To review minor backward-incompatible changes, see [BIC reference]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/reference.html). (Major backward-incompatible issues are described in [BIC highlights]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/index.html). Not all releases introduce major BICs.)

## Security-only patch available

Merchants can now install time-sensitive security fixes without applying the hundreds of functional fixes and enhancements that a full quarterly release (for example, Magento 2.4.0-p1) provides. Patch 2.4.0.1 (Composer package 2.4.0-p1) is a security-only patch that provides fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in our previous quarterly release, Magento 2.4.0. All hot fixes that were applied to the 2.4.0 release are included in this security-only patch. (A *hot fix* provides a fix to a released version of Magento that addresses a specific problem or bug.)

For general information about security-only patches, see the Magento DevBlog post [Introducing the New Security-only Patch Release](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Introducing-the-New-Security-only-Patch-Release/ba-p/141287). For instructions on downloading and applying security-only patches (including patch 2.3.5-p2), see [Install Magento using Composer]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/composer.html). Security-only patches include security bug fixes only, not the additional security enhancements that are included in the full patch.

## Other release information

Although code for these features is bundled with quarterly releases of the Magento core code, several of these projects (for example, B2B, Page Builder, and Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Studio) are also released independently. Bug fixes for these projects are documented in the separate, project-specific release information that is available in the documentation for each project.

## Highlights

Look for the following highlights in this release.

### Substantial security enhancements

This release includes over 15 security fixes and platform security improvements. All security fixes have been backported to Magento 2.4.0-p1 and Magento 2.3.6.

#### Over 15 security enhancements that help close remote code execution (RCE) and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities

No confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. Most of these issues require that an attacker first obtains access to the Admin. As a result, we remind you to take all necessary steps to protect your Admin, including but not limited to these efforts: IP allowlisting, [two-factor authentication]({{page.baseurl}}/security/two-factor-authentication.html), use of a VPN, the use of a unique location rather than `/admin`, and good password hygiene. See [Security Updates Available for Magento](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb20-59.html) for a discussion of these fixed issues.

#### Additional security enhancements

Security improvements for this release include:

*  **CAPTCHA** protection has been added to the following product areas:

   *  Place Order storefront page and REST and GraphQL endpoints <!--- MC-36067-->
   *  Payment-related REST and GraphQL endpoints.<!--- MC-36064-->

   CAPTCHA protection for these additional pages is disabled by default. It can be enabled on the Admin in the same way that other pages covered by CAPTCHA are. This protection has been added as an anti-brute force mechanism to protect stores against carding attacks. See [CAPTCHA](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/security-captcha.html).

*  **Support for the SameSite attribute for cookies**. To support the Google Chrome enforcement of the new cookie classification system, Magento classes that handle cookies have been updated to support the `SameSite` cookie attribute. This attribute is set to `Lax` by default but can be explicitly overridden. <!--- MC-35389-->

*  **Enhanced Magento Scan Tool**. Adobe has partnered with [Sanguine Security](https://sansec.io/), a leader in preventing digital skimming, to integrate their database of over 8700 threat signatures into the Magento Security Scan Tool. This partnership will enable merchants to get real-time insights into the security status of their site through proactive detection of malware and reduction of false positives. Merchants can register for the tool by visiting `https://account.magento.com/scanner`. For more information, see the [Secure Your Storefront With the Enhanced Magento Security Scan Tool](https://magento.com/blog/magento-news/secure-your-storefront-enhanced-magento-security-scan-tool) blog post.

{:.bs-callout-info}
Starting with the release of Magento Commerce 2.3.2, Magento will assign and publish indexed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers with each security bug reported to us by external parties. This allows users of Magento Commerce to more easily identify unaddressed vulnerabilities in their deployment. You can learn more about CVE identifiers at [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/).

### Infrastructure improvements

This release contains enhancements to core quality, which improve the quality of the Framework and these functional areas: Customer Account, Catalog, CMS, OMS, Import/Export, Promotions and Targeting, Cart and Checkout, B2B, and Staging and Preview.

*  **Site-Wide Analysis Tool (SWAT) integration with Magento Admin**. (SWAT) provides system insights and instrumentation for {{ site.data.var.ece }} installations of Magento with 24/7 real-time performance monitoring, reports, and self-service recommendations. Merchants can use the new SWAT Admin role to securely access their SWAT Customer Detail pages through the Magento Admin. See [SWAT FAQ](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048646671) for an overview. For usage information, see [SWAT](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/reports/site-wide-analysis-tool.html). <!--- SWAT-807-->

### Performance improvements

*  **Reduction in the size of network transfers between Redis and Magento**. Plugin list configuration is now generated during the execution of the `bin/magento di:compile` command. This configuration information is written to generated metadata folders based on scope. Previously, this information was stored in cache. Resulting performance improvements include a decrease in network cache size and execution time for many scenarios.<!--- MC-31617-->

*  **Enhanced message queue consumer performance**. Three new configuration settings support a decrease in consumer queue CPU consumption. These optional parameters provide increased control over consumers and save server resources. See [Configure message queues]({{page.baseurl}}/extension-dev-guide/message-queues/config-mq.html) for a description of the `maxIdleTime`, `sleep`, and `onlySpawnWhenMessageAvailable` parameters.

*  **Improved execution time** for `bin/magento` commands.

### Adobe Stock Integration

This release includes Adobe Stock Integration v2.1.0.

### New Media Gallery

The New Media Gallery is now enabled by default in the Admin. Merchants can now perform these actions on images in the Media Gallery:

*  Delete images in bulk
*  Optimize media storage by identifying duplicate images and images that are not used on the storefront
*  Filter images by the storefront area they are used in, including product and category content and CMS blocks
*  Work with image metadata
   *  View metadata from the images uploaded into Media Gallery
   *  Edit image metadata (title, description, and keywords)
   *  Search for images by their metadata

### Page Builder

Page Builder now supports full screen mode, which supports easier editing of content and provides a consistent experience editing content across the Admin. See [Workspace](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/cms/page-builder-workspace.html). <!--- PB-543-->

### GraphQL

This release adds GraphQL coverage for the following features:

*  **Product reviews**. Customers and guests can write product reviews. Customers can retrieve their product review histories. See [Create a product review]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/create-product-review.html) and [productReviewRatingsMetadata query]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/queries/product-review-ratings-metadata.html) for information on retrieving information about the reviews infrastructure.<!--- MC-32349-->

*  **Gift options**. All customers and guests can add a gift message to their order. On {{site.data.var.ee}} installations, they can also add gift wrapping, gift receipts, and printed cards to the order. See [`setGiftOptionsOnCart` mutation]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/set-gift-options.html) and [`updateCartItems` mutation]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/update-cart-items.html) <!--- MC-32345-->

*  **Reward points**. Customers can apply or remove reward points to their carts. They can also view their reward point history. See [`applyRewardPointsToCart`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/apply-reward-points.html) and [`removeRewardPointsFromCart`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/remove-reward-points.html) for a discussion of managing reward points within a cart.<!--- MC-23366-->

*  **Order history**. All customers can view details about their order histories, including invoices, shipping, and refunds.<!--- MC-20635-->

*  **Add to cart**. The [`addProductsToCart` mutation]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/add-products-to-cart.html) allows you to add any type of product to the active cart. We recommend using this mutation instead of single-purpose mutations such as `addSimpleProductsToCart`. _Fix submitted by Yaroslav Rogoza in pull request [27914](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27914)_. [GitHub-28524](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28524)  <!--- MC-21513-->

*  **Stored payment methods**. Logged-in customers can now store payment details (including Braintree credit card and Braintree with PayPal) in My Account. <!--- MC-32348 35945 35946-->

*  **Support for wish lists in Magento Open Source**. Added support for Open Source wish lists. You can [add items]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/add-products-to-wishlist.html) to, [update items]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/update-products-in-wishlist.html) in, and [remove items]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/remove-products-from-wishlist.html) from a wish list.

*  **Improved management of customer accounts**. We have added the [`createCustomerV2`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/create-customer-v2.html) and [`updateCustomerV2`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/update-customer-v2.html) mutations to manage customer accounts. These new mutations require different input objects than the `createCustomer` and `updateCustomer` mutations. To change a customer's email address, use the new [`updateCustomerEmail`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/update-customer-email.html) mutation.

*  **Support for Payflow Pro Vault**. Added GraphQL Vault support for the [Payflow Pro Vault]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/payment-methods/payflow-pro-vault.html) payment method. _Fix submitted by Oleh Usik in pull request [28821](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28821)_. [GitHub-28520](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28520)

*  Updated the GraphQL [`storeConfig` query]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/queries/store-config.html) to include new customer configuration settings. _Fix submitted by Oleh Usik in pull request [27876](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27876)_. [GitHub-28521](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28521)

*  Added the [`requestPasswordResetEmail` mutation]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/request-password-reset-email.html), which triggers the password reset email for the provided email address. _Fix submitted by Oleh Usik in pull request [27876](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27876)_. [GitHub-28521](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28521)

*  **Klarna GraphQL**. Added or updated topics on Klarna GraphQL in [Klarna's payment method]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/payment-methods/klarna.html) and [`createKlarnaPaymentsSession`]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/mutations/create-klarna-payments-session.html)

See the [GraphQL Developer Guide]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/) for details on these enhancements.

## Fixed issues

We have fixed hundreds of issues in the Magento 2.4.1 core code.

### Installation, upgrade, deployment

<!--- MC-36113-->

*  Installation of Magento with third-party extensions that have dependencies on APIs for the Store module in CLI commands no longer fails. Previously, Magento displayed this error message: `The default website isn't defined. Set the website and try again`. This was a known issue in Magento 2.4.0.

<!--- MC-33273-->

*  `bin/magento setup:di:compile` no longer throws a fatal error. Previously, Magento threw an error the first time you ran this command, but the second execution resulted in successful compilation.

<!--- MC-34429-->

*  Upgrade no longer fails when a plugin is declared on `Magento\Framework\Encryption\Encryptor`.

<!--- MC-36231-->

*  Magento now displays an informative error message when some themes are not deployed after running `bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy`. Previously, when deployment completed successfully but not all packages were deployed, Magento did not display an error. When this command is executed with enabled parallel processing and each theme requires more time to be deployed then the specified maximum execution time, this command can finish successfully, although themes are not deployed.

<!--- MC-35001-->

*  The **Use default** checkbox for Klarna payments (**Stores** > **Configuration** > **Sales** > **Payment methods** > **Klarna**) now remain checked as expected when website scope changes.

<!--- MC-17959 ENGCOM-7629-->

*  Running `/bin/magento config:show vendor_module/general/value` now returns `0` or an empty string as expected. Previously, it returned `Configuration for path: "vendor_module/general/value" doesn't exist`. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [28549](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28549)._ [GitHub-23290](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23290)

<!--- MC-33788-->

*  Upgrade no longer results in the sudden failure of the Galera cluster. Previously, the Galera cluster exited abruptly after re-indexing immediately after upgrade. During Magento upgrade, index tables are altered, and the engine is changed from `MEMORY` to `InnoDB`. At this point, the content of these tables became out-of-sync between the nodes of the Galera cluster. [GitHub-25334](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25334)

<!--- MC-34254-->

*  Disabling the PageBuilder module no longer affects the rendering of the product page. Previously, custom layouts on the product page disappeared when the module was disabled, and Magento displayed a blank page.

<!--- ENGCOM-7219-->

*  You can now use `bin/magento sampledata:deploy` to deploy sample data as expected after installing Magento using Composer. Previously, Magento threw this error: `Git installations must deploy sample data from GitHub; see https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/install/sample-data-after-clone.html for more information`. _Fix submitted by Andrii Beziazychnyi in pull request [27481](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27481)_. [GitHub-19481](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/19481)

<!--- ENGCOM-7459-->

*  Storefront performance has improved by eliminating the unnecessary loading of the `Datepicker` component. _Fix submitted by Mateusz Krzeszowiak in pull request [27860](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27860)_. [GitHub-28823](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28823)

<!--- ENGCOM-7265-->

*  Executing `bin/magento setup:upgrade` now completes as expected. Previously, Magento displayed printed array content for caches. _Fix submitted by Sathish Subramanian in pull request [27567](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27567)_. [GitHub-27091](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27091)

<!--- ENGCOM-7853-->

*  `bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy --language=all` now deploys all languages that are used on the storefront and all languages configured by Admin users when no language parameter is set. (`en_US` is always deployed by default.) _Fix submitted by Anton Evers in pull request [28922](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28922)_. [GitHub-29218](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29218)

<!--- ENGCOM-7883-->

*  Magento no longer displays the Backup menu when the Backup feature is disabled. _Fix submitted by Eden Duong in pull request [29222](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29222)_. [GitHub-29280](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29280)

<!--- ENGCOM-7987-->

*  Catalog image helper initialization now uses the product model instead of `DataObject`. _Fix submitted by jmonteros422 in pull request [29435](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29435)_. [GitHub-1711](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1711)

<!--- MC-37226-->

*  Admin users can now save an empty **Customer Token Lifetime (hours)** field (Admin **Stores**  >  **Configurations**  >  **Services**  >  **OAuth**  >  **Access Token Expiration**). [GitHub-29502](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29502)

<!-- ENGCOM-7724 -->

*  The **Create Permanent Redirect for old URL** setting is now disabled by default for categories. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [28752](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28752)_. [GitHub-24922](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24922)

### AdminGWS

<!--- MC-36164-->

*  Magento no longer displays the **Add Attribute** button (**Stores** > **Attributes** or **Add Attribute Set** button (**Stores** > **Attributes** > **Customer**) when the logged-in administrator lacks the appropriate permissions to create these entities. Previously, Magento threw a 404 error when a website administrator who did not have the appropriate permissions tried to create an **Attribute Set** or **Customer** attribute.

<!--- MC-36230-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when an administrator with restricted roles for specific websites tries to create a subcategory from the Admin.

### Adobe Stock Integration

[GitHub-1391](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1391)

<!-- ENGCOM-7981 -->

*  The `Login failed` message that Magento displays when a merchant clicks **License** for a previously saved, unlicensed Adobe Stock image no longer contains HTML tags. _Fix submitted by yolouiese in pull request [29398](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29398)_. [GitHub-1684](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1684)

<!-- ENGCOM-7976 -->

*  Clicking on the links in the **Used in** section of the image Details page now displays a grid that displays all entities that are filtered by the image.

[GitHub-1703](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1703)

### Amazon Pay

*  Amazon Pay now checks whether a user is already logged in before rendering payment options.

*  Issues with multi-factor authentication and abandoned carts have been resolved.

*  Amazon Pay now correctly populates the `store name` in emails and other displayed locations. If the **Store Name** field in Amazon Pay configuration is empty, the extension retrieves the store's default name (that is, the name you give your store in the Magento Admin).

*  Localization/translation issues for Decline scenarios have been addressed. Displayed text is no longer always in English.

### Analytics

<!--- MC-33314-->

*  Administrators with the correct permissions can now access Advanced Reporting and Segment Reports.

<!--- MC-34352-->

*  Magento successfully generates advance reporting data files and sends them as expected to Inventory on deployments with split databases. Previously, Magento did not generate or send the `quotes.csv` file to Inventory, and as a result, Inventory did not generate the expected reports.

*  Braintree now sends the correct amount to PayPal when a promotion code is applied on the checkout page.

*  Apple Pay now works as expected when Magento Terms & Conditions are enabled on the checkout page.

*  Browser errors no longer occur during checkout on desktop devices when Venmo is enabled from the Admin.

*  Checkout no longer fails when the shopper enters special characters in the **Name** fields of the checkout workflow. Previously, authentication failed because the Braintree 3DS API did not support non-ASCII characters.

*  Magento now displays the correct recipient name in the shipping section of the checkout workflow when placing an order using PayPal.

*  Magento now updates the Order Review page as expected when a shopper changes the shipping method more than once during checkout.

*  Merchants can now create a credit memo for bundle products that provides a refund without requiring the return of the product. Previously, Magento threw an error. _Fix submitted by Dzung Nguyen in pull request [27455](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27455)_.

[GitHub-26110](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26110)

### Cache

<!--- MC-36096-->

*  Local cache storage is now retained for the period of time set in **Stores** > **Configuration** > **General** > **Web** > **Default Cookie Settings**. Previously, the expiry date of cookies was hard-coded to one day, which put it out of sync with this setting. As a result, welcome messages did not retain returning customer information for the expected duration.

<!--- ENGCOM-7780-->

*  The number of calls to page cache `config` has been reduced. _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [28992](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28992)_. [GitHub-29159](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29159)

<!--- MC-34999-->

<!--- MC-25042-->

*  A customer’s shipping address is now selected by default at checkout when the address is located in the country identified on the Allow Countries list and that list includes only that country. Previously, Magento did not select the address as default and displayed this error message: `Please specify a regionId in shipping address`.

<!--- MC-24043-->

*  Merchants can now enable **Apply to Shipping Amount** in the Action tab of **Marketing** > **Cart Price Rules** > **Add New Rule** when **Fixed amount discount for whole cart** is applied. [GitHub-24422](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24422)

<!--- MC-23992-->

[GitHub-24218](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/24218)

<!--- MC-33899-->

The appropriate click binding has been added to the `[data-action="close"]` element. _Fix submitted by lumnn in pull request [28906](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28906)_. [GitHub-29161](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29161)

<!--- ENGCOM-7585-->

<!--- MC-35607-->

*  Custom customer address attributes fields are now displayed as expected in the storefront checkout workflow.

[GitHub-29327](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29327)

### Catalog

<!--- MC-31068-->

*  Magento now removes disabled products from a shopper’s cart before checkout. Previously, when a shopper added a product to their cart that was disabled before checkout completed, Magento removed the disabled product from the cart, but the product remained in the quote, and the shopper could not check out. [GitHub-26680](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26680)

<!--- MC-30624-->

*  Shoppers can now open a product’s detail page by clicking on the product name in the compare products sidebar. _Fix submitted by Eduard Chitoraga in pull request [27451](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27451)_. [GitHub-21101](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21101)

<!--- ENGCOM-7513-->

*  `children_count` values now remain positive when an administrator deletes categories. Previously, when an administrator deleted categories, the `children_count` for remaining categories was negative. _Fix submitted by Vitaliy Prokopov in pull request [28044](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28044)_. [GitHub-27969](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27969)

<!--- MC-34314-->

*  Magento now uses the default option (**Configuration** > **Web** > **Default Layouts** > **Default Product Layout**) that you have selected for the `page_layout` attribute when creating a new product. Previously, your selected default value was not applied.

<!--- MC-34258-->

*  You can now successfully perform mass actions on Inventory product stock. Previously, when you tried to perform a mass action on inventory product stock, Magento displayed a blank page. If you performed this action with Magento in developer mode, Magento threw this error: `Notice: Undefined offset: 32000 in /Users/kodithuw/sites/m23inventory/inventory/InventoryCatalogAdminUi/view/adminhtml/templates/catalog/product/edit/action/inventory.phtml on line 24`

<!--- MC-32552-->

<!-- ENGCOM-7854 -->

*  The `{products(filter: {sku: {eq: "some sku"}}) {…}` query now returns values that have been converted into the expected currency. Previously, `price_tiers.final_price.value` displayed special prices in the base currency. _Fix submitted by Petkovski Marjan in pull request [28890](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28890)_. [GitHub-26121](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26121)

[GitHub-28357](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28357)

<!--- MC-35480-->

*  Magento now throws an error when a merchant creates a CMS page with the same URL as the Company Structure page. Previously, Magento displayed the CMS page instead of the Company Structure page.

### Configurable products

<!--- MC-33523-->

*  Pagination problems with the Configurable Product Edit Current Variations list have been corrected.

<!--- MC-33406-->

*  Magento no longer updates the Related Products price box whenever a shopper selects options for a configurable product. Previously, Magento updated the price box whenever a shopper selected an option for a configurable product.

<!--- MC-29882-->

*  Magento now displays the correct price for configurable products with customizable options on the Admin Create Order page. As expected, the displayed price is a sum of the child product's price and the custom option's price. Previously, Magento displayed only the custom option price. [GitHub-25766](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25766)

<!--- MC-33745-->

*  The order summary now displays the correct discount amount when a cart price rule has been applied. Previously, the rule did not correctly round amounts when calculating shipping discounts.

<!--- MC-33765-->

*  Admin user accounts created from an admin account with a restricted scope can now create a configurable product with attributes as expected. Previously, Magento threw this error: `Notice: Undefined index: value_index in 23develop/app/code/Magento/ConfigurableProduct/Helper/Product/Options/Factory.php on line 101`.

<!--- ENGCOM-7787-->

*  Magento no longer throws a validation error when you use POST `/V1/products` to a configurable product with an `int` value of 0.

### Cookies

<!--- ENGCOM-7156-->

*  Magento now creates a maximum of one `mage-translation-file-version` and `mage-translation-storage` cookie per session. _Fix submitted by Ihor Sviziev in pull request [27364](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27364)_. [GitHub-27355](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27355)

### cron

<!--- MC-35884-->

*  Message queue consumer configuration has been extended with new parameters that help control consumers and save server resources and that potentially decrease consumer queue CPU consumption. See [Configure message queues]({{page.baseurl}}/extension-dev-guide/message-queues/config-mq.html) for a description of the `maxIdleTime`, `sleep`, and `onlySpawnWhenMessageAvailable` parameters.

<!--- ENGCOM-7863-->

*  `cron` expressions such as  `3/10 * * * *` are now scheduled as expected. _Fix submitted by Anton Evers in pull request [28930](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28930)_. [GitHub-29240](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29240)

<!--- ENGCOM-7193-->

*  `sales_clean_quotes` no longer loads all expired quotes at once. Previously, Magento failed with this fatal error because all expired quotes were loaded simultaneously: `PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 2147483648 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 20480 bytes) in /path/to/magento2/vendor/magento/framework/Model/AbstractModel.php on line 359`,

### CSS

<!--- ENGCOM-7678-->

*  Magento no longer duplicates CSS when **Critical CSS** is enabled. _Fix submitted by Tu Nguyen in pull request [28480](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28480)_. [GitHub-26498](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26498)

<!--- MC-24981-->

*  The server-side LESS compiler now imports all remote CSS files as expected when you run `bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f`. Previously, Magento did not import the remote files and threw an error. [GitHub-25119](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25119)

### Custom customer attributes

<!--- MC-36387-->

*  Corrected alignment issues for the explanatory text about passwords and the **Job Title** field on the Customer Edit Account Information page.

<!--- MC-33645-->

*  CAPTCHA now works as expected when a new customer clicks the **Create an Account** button on the storefront customer registration page. Previously, Magento did not create the customer account and displayed an error when the customer clicked the button.

<!--- MC-34024-->

*  The checkout workflow no longer displays custom customer address attribute values when the customer has not entered any data.

### Customer

<!--- MC-33679-->

*  The region names in Admin customer addresses are now translated as expected.

<!--- MC-36226-->

*  The **State/Province** fields are now populated as expected on the Edit Address page (**My Account** > **Address book**).

<!--- MC-34655-->

*  Magento no longer throws an error when a customer clicks the **Submit** button multiple times on forms throughout the storefront for which invisible reCAPTCHA has been enabled. Previously, clicking this button multiple times resulted in an internal error similar to this: `Internal error: Make sure you are using reCaptcha V3 api keys`.

<!--- MC-33522-->

*  Saving a deleted customer from the Admin now generates an error message only. Previously, Magento displayed a blank page and generated a report that contains this string: `"0":"No such entity with customerId = 3","1":"#1 Magento\\Customer\\Model CustomerRegistry->retrieve() called at [app\/code\/Magento\/Customer\/Model\/ResourceModel\/CustomerRepository.php:340"`.

<!--- MC-33357-->

*  Magento now displays an error message as expected when an administrator tries to save an address for a customer whose account has just been deleted. Previously, Magento displayed a blank message box.

<!--- MC-33150-->

*  The labels for address fields in the checkout workflow and the address book have been edited for consistency.

<!-- ENGCOM-7244 -->

*  Frontend labels now fall back to store labels if their values are not null. Previously, customer attributes used the default frontend labels. _Fix submitted by Toan Nguyen in pull request [27064](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27064)_. [GitHub-27063](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27063)

<!-- ENGCOM-7147 -->

*  The `sortOrder`number of links in layout XML has been corrected. Previously, this order was reversed and used descending order. _Fix submitted by Tu Nguyen in pull request [27340](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27340)_. [GitHub-27162](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27162)

### Customer segment

<!--- MC-33184-->

*  Bulk operations have been refactored to save and refresh customer segments asynchronously, which has improved the performance of these tasks for deployments that include many customers (greater than 3,000,000).

<!--- MC-36224-->

*  Customer segment conditions now work as expected in a split-database deployment. Previously, Magento threw an error when you tried to edit a customer segment by adding a condition: `SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found`.

### Directory

<!--- MC-32271-->

*  The format of the State/Province drop-down menu is now consistent across the Admin.

### dotdigital

*  Order sync no long fails when an order contains product SKUs that no longer exist in the catalog.

*  Empty product categories are no longer included in web insight data.

*  Web behavior tracking now works for merchants with certain theme configurations. A new fallback selector addresses this.

<!--- MC-34262-->

*  Clicking on a downloadable product's **Sample** button from the Admin product page now downloads a sample as expected. Previously, when you clicked **Sample**, Magento displayed this error: `The product that was requested doesn't exist. Verify the product and try again`.

<!--- ENGCOM-7757-->

*  Shoppers can now download samples of downloadable products that are out-of-stock. Previously, when a shopper tried to download a sample, Magento opened a new tab, but did not display an informative message or begin the download process. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [28898](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28898)_. [GitHub-23638](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/23638)

<!--- MC-33266-->

*  Table title now matches the data table (as expected) when you create a dynamic block and add a related catalog price rule.

<!--- MC-32789-->

*  Magento now sends email notifications about order changes to the correct customer email if the customer email was changed after the order was created.

<!--- MC-36015-->

*  Order update emails that are sent to customers now include the correct order status. Previously, if an order status changed from `processing` to another state, the order email did not reflect the status change.

<!--- MC-34107-->

*  Magento no longer displays misleading messages about existing accounts during guest checkout. Previously, when a guest navigated to the checkout page, then navigated back to the shipping page, Magento displayed this error: `You already have an account with us. Sign in or continue as guest`.

<!--- MC-33905-->

*  Custom email templates now load the same elements as native default email templates. Previously, some elements were missing, including variable values.

<!--- MC-33700-->

<!--- ENGCOM-7506-->

*  Product alert emails are now sent from the store from which the alert is subscribed.

<!--- MC-34153-->

*  Shoppers can now change the number of orders that are displayed per page when the Orders list spans multiple pages. Previously, Magento displayed this message when you navigated to the last page of orders and tried to change the number of orders displayed per page: `You have placed no orders`. This was a known issue for Magento 2.4.0.

<!--- MC-35020-->

*  You can now add products to a category when implementing Level 2 cache.

<!--- MC-29755-->

*  `X-Magento-Tags` headers no longer exceed the size permitted by the HTTP specification. Previously, category pages that contain many products returned an `X-Magento-Tag` header that resulted in a 503 error.

<!--- MC-34257-->

*  `sales_order_shipment_track_save_commit_after` is now triggered as expected when you used the REST API to create a shipment.

<!--- MC-33898-->

*  Magento now displays an informative error message when a `di compile` fails due to a nonexistent dependency. Previously, the message displayed did not identify the class in which the exception occurred.

<!--- MC-32929-->

*  Magento no longer throws the following fatal error when Redis uses all allowed memory: `report.CRITICAL: OOM command not allowed when used memory > 'maxmemory'`.

<!--- MC-18021-->

### General fixes

<!--- MC-36048-->

*  Sorting products on the Admin (**Stores** > **Attributes** > **Products**) now displays all products that meet your search criteria. Previously, Magento did not display records, and to sort the records, you had to navigate to the first page of search results.

<!--- MC-36343-->

*  Unnecessary quotation marks and escaping around a URL in `tracking.phtml` have been removed.

<!--- MC-35998-->

*  The `var/log/system.log` now displays a more accurate message when a user tries to access a non-existing resource file under the static directory and SCD OnDemand and production mode are enabled. Magento now logs a 404 error. Previously, Magento logged the same message that is logged when the error occurs in developer mode.

<!--- ENGCOM-7286-->

*  JavaScript minification now works correctly. The minification file resolver no longer leaks variables to global scope. Previously, `ctx`, `origNameToUrl`, and `baseUrl` variables under window were leaked. _Fix submitted by Mateusz Krzeszowiak in pull request [27622](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27622)_. [GitHub-28110](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28110)

<!--- ENGCOM-7532-->

*  When you debug an error that prevents object creation, Magento now prints as well as logs the original exception message. Previously, the message was only logged. _Fix submitted by Marvin Hinz in pull request [26572](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26572)_. [GitHub-26550](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26550)

<!--- ENGCOM-7577-->

*  Callback execution after database changes are committed has been improved. Previously, if one callback failed with an exception, all callbacks failed. _Fix submitted by Alok Patel in pull request [27134](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27134)_. [GitHub-28167](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28167)

<!--- ENGCOM-7447-->

[GitHub-28340](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28340)

<!--- ENGCOM-7299-->

<!--- ENGCOM-7610-->

*  Multi-page storefront orders lists now behave as expected when a shopper changes the number of results displayed per page from the second or subsequent results page. Previously, Magento displayed this error when a shopper changed the number of search results displayed in the **My Account** > **My Orders** list: `You have placed no orders`. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [28417](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28417)_. [GitHub-28488](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28488)

[GitHub-25211](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/25211)

<!--- MC-35550-->

*  An expired persistent session is now renewed as expected when the shopper logs back in.

<!--- MC-35230-->

*  Password lifetime as set in **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **Admin** is now honored. Previously, if you clicked **Forgot password?** when prompted to reset your password, you could bypass the password reset.

<!--- MC-34369-->

*  Coupon codes are now applied only to the specified product. Previously, Magento applied the coupon code to all products in the cart. [GitHub-28246](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28246)

<!--- MC-35008-->

*  Cart expiry settings are no longer re-set when an inventory or price update occurs. Previously, when a cart was set to expire in 24 hours, and an inventory update or price update occurred, the indexers populated the `updated_at table`, which re-set the expiry time.

<!--- MC-33313-->

*  Magento no longer throws a fatal error when an administrator assigns a customer who has an active shopping cart to a customer group.

<!-- ENGCOM-7834 -->

<!--- ENGCOM-7420-->

*  Magento now adds an admin user’s ACL role ID to the product category tree cache ID. This will limit the category trees that an admin with limited scope can see as expected. _Fix submitted by quangdo-aligent in pull request [27429](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27429)_. [GitHub-28306](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28306)

### Gift cards

<!--- MC-36118-->

*  Gift card accounts now capture order numbers as expected. Previously, the **More information** field in the History tab for the selected gift account did not display order IDs.

<!--- MC-34519-->

*  Using a comma as a decimal separator now works as expected. Previously, the comma separator ignored decimal values.

<!--- MC-34469-->

<!--- MC-35479-->

*  The `error_report.csv` file now downloads with content and is available inside the `var/import_history/` directory as expected. Previously, this file was not generated after import.

<!--- ENGCOM-7616-->

*  Importing a product by using a CSV file now generates an `error_report.csv` file as expected. Previously, Magento generated the file but removed it after the import completed. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [28460](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28460)_. [GitHub-28420](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28420)

<!--- ENGCOM-7673-->

*  Removed redundant class imports throughout code base. _Fix submitted by Oleh Usik in pull request [28696](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28696)_. [GitHub-29012](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29012)

<!--- MC-33730-->

<!--- MC-33277-->

*  Magento now loads the correct entity attribute set when a merchant selects an entity type when scheduling a new export.

<!--- MC-32956-->

*  The position of products in the `catalog_category_product` table now updates as expected when an administrator creates a product in the Admin and assigns it to a category. Previously, the position of new products was always assigned a 0 value.

<!--- MC-34939-->

*  Customer data is now successfully exported from the Admin, and the export data grid displays customer data as expected. Previously, an error related to memory allocation occurred during export.

<!--- MC-34657-->

*  Imported CSV files now capture related product information as expected. Previously, related product information was not consistently uploaded the first time the CSV file was imported.

<!--- MC-37424-->

*  Removed unused construct parameters in `AdvancedPricing.php`. [GitHub-29531](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29531)

### Index

<!--- ENGCOM-7073-->

*  `Magento_CacheInvalidate` now handles large tag patterns correctly when doing a `PURGE`. `sendPurgeRequest` has been refactored to handle an array of tags instead of requiring the caller to use `implode()`. _Fix submitted by Matthew O'Loughlin in pull request [26256](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26256)_. [GitHub-26255](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26255)

<!--- MC-30568-->

*  Shared indexers now show a status of **valid** after you run `bin/magento indexer:status` after re-indexing. Previously, shared indexers had an **invalid** status after a full re-index.

### Infrastructure

<!--- MC-37243-->

*  Problems loading catalog and product pages on deployments running PHP 7.4.9 no longer occur. Previously, Magento threw this error when you tried to load the catalog and product pages: `There has been an error processing your request. Exception printing is disabled by default for security reasons`. [GitHub-29502](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29502)

<!--- ENGCOM-7994-->

*  All exceptions that occur when layouts are rendered in production mode are now logged in the exception log file (`var/report`). Previously, Magento logged these messages in the system log as critical issues.

<!--- ENGCOM-7154-->

*  Regular expressions now work properly for large pages as the result of an increase in `ipcre.backtrack_limi`t and `pcre.recursion_limit` to approximately 1000000. _Fix submitted by Mateusz Krzeszowiak in pull request [27270](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27270)_. [GitHub-26026](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26026)

<!--- ENGCOM-7483-->

*  Interceptor generation has been improved. `} else {` statements have been removed from interceptors, and `array_map` has replaced `foreach`. _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [27902](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27902)_. [GitHub-28383](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28383)

<!--- ENGCOM-7651-->

*  Array creation is now consistent throughout the class (`app/code/Magento/Sales/Model/Order/Pdf/Items/Invoice/DefaultInvoice.php`). _Fix submitted by Nathan de Graaf in pull request [28515](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28515)_. [GitHub-28795](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28795)

<!--- ENGCOM-7484-->

*  Plugins have been migrated out of the Magento Framework to follow the Magento best practice of prohibiting plugins in the Framework namespace. _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [27965](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27965)_. [GitHub-27962](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/27962)

<!--- ENGCOM-7713-->

*  Magento no longer throws an `Undefined class constant` error when an interceptor is generated. _Fix submitted by Vova Yatsyuk in pull request [28797](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28797)_. [GitHub-28981](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28981)

<!--- ENGCOM-7523-->

*  Form data now persists when Magento throws an integration exception when you save a integration using a name that is already in use. _Fix submitted by Aditya Yadav in pull request [26660](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26660)_. [GitHub-28143](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28143)

<!--- ENGCOM-7820-->

*  The logic that checks if a redirect is internal now works correctly in the Admin when using a custom Admin domain. Previously, problems with this logic resulted in many Admin redirects to the homepage of the default store. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [29066](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29066)_. [GitHub-28943](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28943)

<!--- ENGCOM-7758-->

<!--- ENGCOM-7926-->

*  `ResourceConnection.php` has been refactored to improve class readability. _Fix submitted by Lukasz Bajsarowicz in pull request [29341](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29341)_. [GitHub-29389](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29389)

<!--- ENGCOM-7814-->

*  The `Magento\CmsUrlRewrite\Plugin\Cms\Model\Store\View::aftersSave` plugin now returns a value as expected. Previously, this plugin did not return a value, and as a result, saving a store view resulted in an error. _Fix submitted by Pieter Hoste in pull request [29035](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29035)_. [GitHub-29034](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29034)

<!--- ENGCOM-7566-->

*  Added the following support for magic methods for `DataObject`:

   *  new extension to support `get/set/has/uns` magic methods (with usage of `__call`)
   *  support for SessionManager, which forwards all calls to the DataObject container
   *  test coverage for extensions
   *  updated tests for Filtered Error check
   *  increased PHPStan check level from 0 to 1. _Fix submitted by Oleksandr Kravchuk in pull request [27905](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27905)_. [GitHub-28303](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28303)

<!--- ENGCOM-7906-->

*  `ScopeConfigInterface` can now be more than a string. The restriction of `magentoConfigFixture` to string only was the inadvertent result of a previous pull request and has been reverted. _Fix submitted by Kristof, Fooman in pull request [29305](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29305)_. [GitHub-29345](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29345)

<!--- ENGCOM-8000-->

*  The `convertConfigTimeToUtc` method no longer throws a fatal error due to sending incorrect parameters to the `Phrase` constructor. _Fix submitted by Kos Rafał in pull request [29483](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29483)_. [GitHub-29525](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29525)

<!-- ENGCOM-7962 -->

*  Price filters now work as expected on grid data when `Magento\Backend\Block\Widget\Grid\Column\Filter\Price::getCondition` and `Magento\Backend\Block\Widget\Grid\Column\Filter\Price::getValue()` return an array with indexes that contain `from` or `to` string data. Previously, Magento threw this error: `Notice: A non well formed numeric value encountered in vendor/magento/module-backend/Block/Widget/Grid/Column/Filter/Price.php on line 197`. _Fix submitted by Nikita Sarychev in pull request [29214](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29214)_. [GitHub-29213](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29213)

<!-- ENGCOM-7911 -->

*  Added an extension point to support adding HTML to the category page. This corrects a bug that was introduced by a previous pull request. _Fix submitted by iGerchak in pull request [29291](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29291)_. [GitHub-29286](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29286)

<!--- ENGCOM-7979-->

*  Unnecessary code comments have been removed from `app/code/Magento/CatalogInventory/Model/StockState.php`. _Fix submitted by Vitaliy Prokopov in pull request [27758](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27758)_. [GitHub-26702](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26702)

### Layered navigation

<!--- MC-25043-->

*  The layered navigation sidebar now shows Boolean attributes with both options (**yes**/**no**) and matching product counts. Previously, layered navigation did not return a **no** option for Boolean attributes in deployments using Elasticsearch.

<!--- ENGCOM-7493-->

*  The swatch layered navigation filter is now consistent with standard filters used throughout Magento. _Fix submitted by Bartłomiej Szubert in pull request [28015](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28015)_. [GitHub-28011](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28011)

### Logging

<!--- ENGCOM-7692-->

*  All broken reference errors are now logged when deployments are in developer mode only. Previously, one error was logged for deployments in production mode, too, which bloated error logs. _Fix submitted by Bartłomiej Szubert in pull request [28735](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28735)_. [GitHub-26504](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26504)

### Media Gallery

<!--- ENGCOM-8014-->

*  The Media Gallery configuration UI (Admin **Stores**  >  **Configuration**  >   **Advanced**  >  **System**) has been reorganized. _Fix submitted by Shankar Konar in pull request [29433](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29433)_. [GitHub-28011](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1738)

<!--- ENGCOM-8006-->

*  Magento no longer throws an exception when a merchant tries to save a product with its associated image when the Media Gallery is disabled. _Fix submitted by Nazar Klovanych in pull request [29492](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29492)_. [GitHub-1750](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/issues/1750)

### MFTF

<!-- ENGCOM-7963 -->

*  The `AdminSubmitAdvancedInventoryFormActionGroup`, `AdminClickOnAdvancedInventoryLinkActionGroup`, and  `AdminSetStockStatusConfigActionGroup` action groups are now used within tests according to best practice. _Fix submitted by Oleh USIA in pull request [29386](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29386)_.

#### New tests

<!-- ENGCOM-7600 -->

*  Added test for deleting a CMS page as an Admin user. _Fix submitted by Dmitry Tsymbal in pull request [28112](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28112)_. [GitHub-28202](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28202)

*  Added the `StorefrontShareCustomerWishlistActionGroup` test for customer wishlist sharing with invalid email addresses. The existing test for wish list sharing (`StorefrontShareWishlistEntityTest`) has been refactored. `StorefrontCustomerShareWishlistActionGroup` has been deprecated.

<!-- ENGCOM-7682 -->

*  Added a test to check for the implementation of the **Only X left Threshold** configuration setting. _Fix submitted by Oleh Usik in pull request [27549](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27549)_. [GitHub-28755](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28755)

### Newsletter

<!--- MC-34714-->

*  Exporting the Newsletter Subscribers list using the `Excel XML` option now results in the export of all rows as expected. Previously, exported data included only the page pagination value, not all rows.

<!--- ENGCOM-7522-->

*  Newsletter subscription emails now use the same HTML tags as other newsletter-related emails. _Fix submitted by Paweł Tylek in pull request [27357](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27357)_. [GitHub-28166](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28166)

<!--- ENGCOM-7788-->

*  Adds a test for deleting newsletter subscriber as an Admin user. _Fix submitted by Dmitry Tsymbal in pull request [28972](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28972)_. [GitHub-29032](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29032)

<!--- ENGCOM-7739-->

*  Added tests for newsletter subscription for guests with a disallowed option in config statements. This test replaces deprecated `VerifyRegistredLinkDisplayedForGuestSubscriptionNoTest` and `StorefrontCreateNewSubscriberActionGroup`. _Fix submitted by Dmitry Tsymbal in pull request [28872](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28872)_. [GitHub-29039](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29039)

### Orders

<!--- ENGCOM-7858-->

*  The `GetAssetIdByContentFieldInterface` and its implementation on `MediaContent` modules now permits Adobe Stock Integration to extend `MediaGallery` filter functionality. _Fix submitted by Gabriel da Gama in pull request [29058](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29058)_. [GitHub-1464](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/1464)

<!--- ENGCOM-7885-->

*  The `CustomerAddressI` values for a newly created customer is now validated in quotes. _Fix submitted by Andrii Kalinich in pull request [29139](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29139)_. [GitHub-28793](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28793)

<!--- ENGCOM-7798-->

*  The order status for a credit memo with zero total is now `Closed`. Previously, Magento reported its order status as `Complete`. _Fix submitted by Andrii Kalinich in pull request [29023](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29023)_. [GitHub-22762](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/22762)

### Page Builder

<!--- ENGCOM-7918-->

*  The `description` and `short_description` product attributes have been re-ordered to better accommodate planned changes to Page Builder content staging. _Fix submitted by Matt Walters in pull request [29238](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/29238)_. [GitHub-543](https://github.com/magento/magento2-page-builder/issues/543)

### Payment methods

<!--- MC-34363-->

*  Magento now displays a message that prompts you to enter mandatory credit card data when you click **Submit** for an Admin order without entering valid payment information. Previously, the Braintree card validator did not throw an error when payment input fields were invalid and the page became inactive.

<!--- MC-33494-->

*  You can now change the shipping method for an order you create from the Admin for a customer whose account has a stored credit card (Braintree). Previously, when you selected a different shipping method, the stored card was not selected, and Magento did not place the order.

#### PayPal

<!--- MC-33879-->

*  The Order Review page of the checkout workflow now displays the correct shipping amount for PayPal through Braintree orders for which the shipping method has been changed during checkout. Previously, when a customer changed the shipping method on the PayPal Order Review page of the checkout workflow, Magento did not update the order total with the correct method.

<!--- MC-34152-->

*  Merchants can now successfully cancel orders that were authorized using PayPal. Previously, Magento did not cancel the order and displayed this error: `Declined: 10601-Authorization has expired`.

<!--- MC-33330-->

*  Magento no longer empties your cart when you cancel an order by closing the PayPal payment popup window after first completing another order.

### Performance

*  Three new configuration settings support a decrease in consumer queue CPU consumption. These optional parameters provide increased control over consumers and save server resources. See [Configure message queues]({{page.baseurl}}/extension-dev-guide/message-queues/config-mq.html) for a description of the `maxIdleTime`, `sleep`, and `onlySpawnWhenMessageAvailable` parameters.

<!--- MC-31617-->

*  Plugin list configuration is now generated during the execution of the `di:compile` command. This configuration information is written to generated metadata folders based on scope. Previously, this information was stored in cache. Resulting performance improvements include:

   *  Network cache size has decreased
   *  Execution time for many scenarios has been improved.

<!--- ENGCOM-7290-->

*  Magento now loads the appropriate slider widget on demand, which has improved page loading. The touch slider widget customization has been moved to a separate file so it can be loaded only on compatible devices. The appropriate slider widget type is now loaded only when range binding is actually used on the page. _Fix submitted by Mateusz Krzeszowiak in pull request [27616](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/27616)_. [GitHub-28807](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/28807)

<!--- MC-33107-->

*  The performance of checkout with multiple simultaneous orders has been improved.

<!--- MC-25062-->

*  Deadlocks no longer occur when the import process executes a bulk insert and the re-index process simultaneously executes a large insert from select. Previously, Magento displayed this error: `PDOException: SQLSTATE[40001]: Serialization failure: 1213 Deadlock found when trying to get lock`. [GitHub-8933](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8933)

### Return Merchandise Authorizations (RMA)

<!--- MC-35984-->

*  The Returns page now works as expected after you create a shipping label for a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA). Previously, merchants could not interact with any page elements on the Returns page after creating a shipping label for an RMA. This was a known issue for 2.4.0, and `MC-35984-2.4.0-CE-composer.patch` addressed this issue for Magento 2.4.0.

<!--- MC-35826-->

*  Magento now displays either an informative error message or all available products when an administrator with restricted permissions tries to create a return for products that are no longer in the assigned website scope. Previously, Magento displayed a blank page.

### Reviews

<!--- MC-33405-->

*  A unique key for `entity_pk_value-entity_type-store_id` has been added to the `review_entity_summary` table, which prevents the creation of duplicate rows for the same product ID (`entity_pk_value`). Previously, this lack of unique key resulted in duplicate rows for the same product ID and SQL errors.

### Sales

<!--- MC-35675-->

*  Magento no longer assigns a status of `Complete` after invoicing to an order that requires zero payment.

<!--- MC-35888-->

*  The New Shipment email generated by the REST API now contains the same shipping and customer information as shipments that are created manually from the Admin. Previously, this email did not contain the customer name, tracking information, products ordered, and other order information.

<!--- MC-35837-->

*  Guest user names are now visible as expected in invoice- and shipment-related emails when the emails are loaded or customized from the Admin.

<!--- MC-35707-->

*  The PDF invoice is now translated into the language of the store view where the order has been placed. Previously, the PDF invoice was translated in the language of the Admin.

<!--- MC-35858-->

*  You can now issue a refund as expected from the credit memo page. [GitHub-29014](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29014)

<!--- MC-35353-->

*  Localised region names that are displayed on the storefront Order page are now correctly translated. Previously, the region name was not based on the specified locale unless it was edited in the Admin.

<!--- MC-35633-->

*  Shipments created through the POST `/rest/V1/shipment` endpoint now update orders properly. Previously, Magento created a shipment, but shipment status remained in the processing state.

<!--- MC-33952-->

*  Elasticsearch results now include the correct values for each store view’s attribute options.

Previously, Elasticsearch did not index that value or return the product with that value in the results.

<!--- MC-35013-->

*  Searching by SKU now works as expected in advanced search with Elasticsearch. Previously, when you tried to search by SKU, Magento displayed this error message: `We can't find any items matching these search criteria. Modify your search`.

<!--- ENGCOM-7222-->

<!--- MC-35955-->

*  Customers can now successfully remove reward points on the order review page of the checkout workflow when checking out with multiple addresses. Previously, Magento threw a `404 Not Found` error when a customer clicked the **Remove** button to remove points for any address. This was a known issue in Magento 2.4.0.

<!--- MC-33572-->

*  You can now use POST `/V1/products/special-price` to update a product’s special price without specifying a `price_to` parameter value. Previously, attempts to set the price update without the `price_to` parameter specified were unsuccessful.

### Store

<!--- MC-35853-->

*  Deleting a previously created store view no longer results in an error in deployments with a split database configuration. Previously, Magento threw an exception.

<!--- MC-32634-->

*  You can now export `config.php` and default website code from one website to install and configure Magento on a second website in a multi website deployment. Previously, the default store and view disappeared after the export, and errors occurred on the storefront.

### Swagger

<!--- ENGCOM-7720-->

*  You can now generate a customer token with Swagger. Previously, Swagger did not generate a response code when valid customer access information was entered, and Magento displayed this error: `The account sign-in was incorrect or your account is disabled temporarily. Please wait and try again later`. _Fix submitted by Vadim Malesh in pull request [28822](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28822)_.

<!--- ENGCOM-7829-->

*  Magento now checks area (frontend or `adminhtml`) before rendering inline translation markup. Previously, making an API call to `/rest/V1/integration/admin/token` with bad credentials while inline translation was enabled results in the inclusion of inline translation markup around the error message in the API response. _Fix submitted by Zach Nanninga in pull request [28856](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28856)_.

<!-- ENGCOM-7631 -->

*  The **Ship here** button label on the checkout workflow shipping address modal has been changed to match the camel case used for other buttons. This case now matches the case that is used in the translation files. Previously, because of the mismatch in case, this label was not translated. _Fix submitted by WK in pull request [28547](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/28547)_.

## Known issues

**Issue**: The new CAPTCHA feature for checkout does not work as expected on the Place Order page when using third-party payment providers. Merchants running Magento 2.3.6 or 2.4.1 who have enabled CAPTCHA protection on the Place Order storefront page will see this error when checking out using a third-party payment provider such as PayPal: `Please provide CAPTCHA code and try again`. **Workaround**: A fix for this issue is now available. See the [Magento Commerce v2.3.6/2.4.1 CAPTCHA in checkout not working](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051235772) Knowledge Base article. A fix will also be included in our next quarterly patch (Q12021).

**Issue**: Users without administrator privileges cannot currently set up their personal 2FA access. 2FA as implemented in Magento includes two ACL roles. One role affects global system configuration and it is needed only when configuring the system. The second ACL role affects individual user 2FA accounts. An admin user must configure this second type of 2FA ACL. **Workaround**:  After the user has logged in and seen the Access denied screen, they can visit `https://<magento store>/<admin_path>/tfa/tfa/requestconfig/` to force configuration. Note: We do not recommend disabling security settings. However, this workaround is effective only when Admin URL secret keys are disabled.

**Issue**: The **Create an Account** button on the Create New Account page remains disabled if a shopper has entered invalid data. This prevents shoppers from re-attempting to create an account after making an error. **Workaround**: Apply patch `MC-38509`. A fix will also be included in our next quarterly releases (2.4.2, 2.4.1-p1 and 2.3.6-p1), which are scheduled for release in Q1 2021. See the [2.4.1 and 2.3.6 create an account button disabled hotfix](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051130212) Knowledge Base article.  [GitHub-30513](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30513)

**Issue**: Merchants cannot log in to dotdigital from the Admin in Safari when dotdigital is enabled. See the [It's impossible to login in the dotdigital via admin panel when dotdigital account is enabled](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050092291) Knowledge Base article.

**Issue**: Vertex address validation does not work during payment when the shopper selects a shipping address that differs from the billing address. The issue will be fixed in Magento 2.4.2. See the [Magento 2.4.1 known issue: Vertex Address Validation message does not disappear after updating address](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050139631) Knowledge Base article.

**Issue**: Magento displays an empty page when a merchant saves a dotdigital Page Builder form on the Safari browser. **Workaround**: Reload the page to apply your changes. See the [Magento 2.4.1 known issue: empty page after saving dotdigital Page Builder form](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049819092) Knowledge Base article.

**Issue**: Under certain conditions, Magento automatically signs in customers to previously used Amazon accounts rather prompting them to log in during checkout with Amazon Pay. See the [Magento 2.4.1 known issue: unable to change Amazon account in Google Chrome](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049814152) Knowledge Base article.

**Issue**: Magento briefly displays an error message on the billing page of the checkout workflow when PayPal Braintree payment and multiple addresses shipment are selected. See the [Magento 2.4.1 known issue: error popping up on Checkout with PayPal Braintree](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050253211) Knowledge Base article.

**Issue**: Magento displays a non-informative error message when a guest customer tries to place an order with PayPal through Braintree when guest checkout is disabled. See the [Magento 2.4.1 known issue: non-informative error message during guest checkout using Paypal through Braintree](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050368111) Knowledge Base article.
