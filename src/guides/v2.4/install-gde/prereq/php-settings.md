This topic discusses how to set required [PHP](https://glossary.magento.com/php) options.

{:.bs-callout-info}
See [system requirements]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/system-requirements.html) for supported versions of PHP.

## Verify PHP is installed {#centos-verify-php}

Most flavors of Linux have PHP installed by default.
This topic assumes that you have already installed PHP.
To verify if PHP is installed already, in the command line, type:

```bash
php -v
```

If [PHP](https://glossary.magento.com/php) is installed, a message similar to the following displays:

```terminal
PHP 7.4.0 (cli) (built: Aug 14 2019 16:42:46) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) 1997-2018 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.1.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2018 Zend Technologies with Zend OPcache v7.1.6, Copyright (c) 1999-2018, by Zend Technologies
```

Magento 2.4 is compatible with PHP 7.3, but we test with, and recommend using, PHP 7.4.

If PHP is not installed, or a version upgrade is needed, install it following instructions for your particular Linux flavor.
On CentOS, [additional steps may be required][].

## Verify installed extensions

Magento requires a set of extensions to be installed.

{% include install/php-extensions-template.md %}

{:.procedure}
To verify installed extensions:

1. List installed modules.

   ```bash
   php -m
   ```

1. Verify that all required extensions are installed.
1. Add any missing modules using the same workflow used for installing PHP. For example, if you use `yum` to install PHP, the PHP 7.4 modules can be added with:

   ```bash
    yum -y install php74u-pdo php74u-mysqlnd php74u-opcache php74u-xml php74u-gd php74u-devel php74u-mysql php74u-intl php74u-mbstring php74u-bcmath php74u-json php74u-iconv php74u-soap
   ```

## Check PHP settings

{:.bs-callout-warning}
If you are using PHP 7.4.20, set `pcre.jit=0` in your `php.ini` file. This will get around a PHP [bug](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=81101) that prevents CSS from loading.

-  Set the system time zone for PHP; otherwise, errors like the following display during the installation and time-related operations like cron might not work:

```terminal
PHP Warning:  date(): It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings. [more messages follow]
```

-  Set the PHP memory limit.

   Our detailed recommendations are:

   -  Compiling code or deploying static assets, `1G`
   -  Debugging, `2G`
   -  Testing, `~3-4G`

-  Increase the values for the PHP `realpath_cache_size` and `realpath_cache_ttl` to recommended settings:

   ```conf
   realpath_cache_size=10M
   realpath_cache_ttl=7200
   ```

   These settings allow PHP processes to cache paths to files instead of looking them up each time a page loads. See [Performance Tuning](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php) in the PHP documentation.

-  Enable [`opcache.save_comments`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/opcache.configuration.php#ini.opcache.save-comments), which is required for Magento 2.1 and later.

   We recommend you enable the [PHP OPcache](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php) for performance reasons. The OPcache is enabled in many PHP distributions.

   Magento 2.1 and later use PHP code comments for code generation.

{:.bs-callout-info}
To avoid issues during installation and upgrade, we strongly recommend you apply the same PHP settings to both the PHP command-line configuration and the PHP web server plug-in configuration. For more information, see the next section.

## Step 1: Find PHP configuration files {#php-required-find}

This section discusses how you find the configuration files necessary to update required settings.

### Find `php.ini` configuration file

To find the web server configuration, run a [`phpinfo.php` file]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/prereq/optional.html#install-optional-phpinfo) in your web browser and look for the `Loaded Configuration File` as follows:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/config_phpini-webserver.png)

To locate the PHP command-line configuration, enter

```bash
php --ini | grep "Loaded Configuration File"
```

{:.bs-callout-info}
If you have only one `php.ini` file, make the changes in that file. If you have two `php.ini` files, make the changes in *all* files. Failure to do so might cause unpredictable performance.

### Find OPcache configuration settings

PHP OPcache settings are typically located either in `php.ini` or `opcache.ini`. The location might depend on your operating system and PHP version. The OPcache configuration file might have an `opcache` section or settings like `opcache.enable`.

Use the following guidelines to find it:

-  Apache web server:

   For Ubuntu with Apache, OPcache settings are typically located in `php.ini`.

   For CentOS with Apache or nginx, OPcache settings are typically located in `/etc/php.d/opcache.ini`

   If not, use the following command to locate it:

   ```bash
   sudo find / -name 'opcache.ini'
   ```

-  nginx web server with PHP-FPM: `/etc/php/7.2/fpm/php.ini`

If you have more than one `opcache.ini`, modify all of them.

## Step 2: How to set PHP options {#php-required-set}

To set PHP options:

1. Open a `php.ini` in a text editor.
1. Locate your server's time zone in the available [time zone settings](https://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php)
1. Locate the following setting and uncomment it if necessary:

   ```conf
   date.timezone =
   ```

1. Add the time zone setting you found in step 2.

1. Change the value of `memory_limit` to one of the values recommended at the beginning of this section.

   For example,

   ```conf
   memory_limit=2G
   ```

1. Add or update the `realpath_cache` configuration to match the following values:

   ```conf
   ;
   ; Increase realpath cache size
   ;
   realpath_cache_size = 10M

   ;
   ; Increase realpath cache ttl
   ;
   realpath_cache_ttl = 7200
   ```

1. Save your changes and exit the text editor.

1. Open the other `php.ini` (if they are different) and make the same changes in it.

## Step 3: Set OPcache options {#php-required-opcache}

To set `opcache.ini` options:

1. Open your OPcache configuration file in a text editor:

   -  `opcache.ini` (CentOS)
   -  `php.ini` (Ubuntu)
   -  `/etc/php/7.2/fpm/php.ini` (nginx web server (CentOS or Ubuntu))

1. Locate `opcache.save_comments` and uncomment it if necessary.
1. Make sure its value is set to `1`.
1. Save your changes and exit the text editor.
1. Restart your web server:

   -  Apache, Ubuntu: `service apache2 restart`
   -  Apache, CentOS: `service httpd restart`
   -  nginx, Ubuntu and CentOS: `service nginx restart`
