The full list of software is listed in [System Requirements]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/system-requirements.html) but here are the essentials:

*  Web server for providing access to web pages - Currently, we have documented [Apache](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server) and [NGINX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx).

*  Database management system for long-term data storage and retrieval - We support [MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/what-is-mysql.html).

*  PHP - PHP is an open source scripting language suited for web development because it can be embedded in [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) (the language of the web).

   For more information, see the [PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php) or the [PHP Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP).

*  Search engine - [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) provides a search and analytics engine to help customers find the products they want to buy.
