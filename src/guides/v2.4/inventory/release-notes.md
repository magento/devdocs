**{{site.data.var.im}} (provided by the [Magento Inventory (was MSI)](https://github.com/magento/inventory) project)** is available with {{site.data.var.ce}}, {{site.data.var.ee}}, and {{site.data.var.ece}} 2.4. Merchants can use {{site.data.var.im}} to manage inventory for all product types in a single warehouse and across complex shipping networks. Manage these locations as sources, tracking on-hand inventory quantities per product. Stocks connect these sources with sales channels (websites) to provide an accurate salable quantity, calculating available on-hand products, pending orders (reservations), and configured thresholds. {{site.data.var.im}} also updates order and shipment options, giving you full control over your inventory and deductions at the source level.

{{site.data.var.im}} is a Magento Community Engineering special project open to contributors. To take part and contribute, see the [MSI GitHub](https://github.com/magento/inventory) repository and [wiki](https://github.com/magento/inventory/wiki) to get started. Join us in our [Slack](https://magentocommeng.slack.com/messages/C5FU5E2HY) channel ([self signup](https://tinyurl.com/engcom-slack)) to discuss the project.
