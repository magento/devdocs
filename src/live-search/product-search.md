Live Search uses the `productSearch` query to search for products instead of the `products` query, which is provided with {{site.data.var.ce}}. Although the two queries are functionally similar, they have different input requirements. The `products` query returns information that is relevant for layered navigation, while the `productSearch` query returns faceting data and other features that are specific to Live Search.

## Construct the query

The `productSearch` query accepts the following fields as input:

-  `phrase` - The string of text to search for. This field is required.
-  `filter` - An object that defines one or more product attributes to use to narrow the search results. In the Luma theme, the `sku`, `price`, and `size` attributes are among the product attributes that can be used to filter query results.
-  `sort` - An object that defines one or more product attributes to use to sort the search results. The default sortable product attributes in Luma are `price`, `name`, and `position`. A product's position is assigned within a category.
-  `page_size` and `current_page` - These optional fields allow the search results to be broken down into smaller groups so that a limited number of items are returned at a time. The default value of `page_size` is `20`, and the default value for `current_page` is `1`. In the response, counting starts at page one.

### Field Reference

The following sections describe each field in detail.

#### phrase

The `phrase` field contains the text that a shopper enters on the storefront. Live Search applies all configured rules, synonyms and other configuration settings to return determine the search results. All `productSearch` queries must contain the `phrase` field.

The following example sets `Watch` as the phrase to search for:

```graphql
phrase: "Watch"
```

#### filter

Filters are the part of the query that uses product attributes as facets that have been previously defined in the {{site.data.var.ee}} Admin. For example, to filter results by color, a color facet must be defined in Live Search, based on the existing `color` attribute.

A filter consists of a product `attribute`, a comparison operator, and the value that is being searched for. Together, they help narrow down the search results, based on shopper input. For example, if you want to set up a filter for jackets based on size, you could set the product attribute to `size`. To filter on medium-sized jackets only, set the `eq` field to `M`. To filter on both medium- and large-sized jackets, set the `in` field to `["M", "L"]`. If an attribute is numeric, you can filter on it as a price range, such as between $50 and $100. To filter on a price range, set the `attribute` to `price`, and assign the `range` field with `from` and `to` values as `50` and `100`, respectively.

You can define multiple filters in the same call. The following example filters on the price and size:

```graphql
filter: [
    {
      attribute: "price"
      range: {
        from: 50
        to: 100
      }
    },
    {
      attribute: "size"
      in: ["M", "L"]
    }
]
```

An attribute must be set to `filterableInSearch: true` if it is passed in as part of the filter. Otherwise, a "500 error" will be returned.

Only facets specified in Live Search are returned.

Use the [`attributeMetadata` query]({{ site.baseurl }}/live-search/attribute-metadata.html) to return a list of product attributes that can be used to define a filter.

#### sort

The `sort` field allows you to specify one or more product attributes to be used to sort the results. If you specify more than one attribute, Live Search sorts by the first field listed. If any items have the same value, those items are sorted by the secondary field. The value for each field can be set to either `ASC` or `DESC`.

The following example causes the query to filter first by `price`, and then by `name`:

```graphql
sort: [
    {
        attribute: "price"
        direction: DESC
    }
    {
        attribute: "name"
        direction: DESC
    }
]
```

{:.bs-callout-tip}
Use the [`attributeMetadata` query]({{ site.baseurl }}/live-search/attribute-metadata.html) to return a list of product attributes that can be used to define a filter.

#### page_size

When you run a query, you do not know in advance how many items the query will return. The query could return a few items, or it could return hundreds. The `page_size` field determines how many items to return at one time. If you use the default value of 20, and the query returns 97 items, the results will be stored in four pages containing 20 items each, and one page containing 17 items.

The following example sets the page size to 10:

```graphql
page_size: 10
```

#### current_page

The `currentPage` field specifies which page of results to return. If no value is specified, the first page is returned. To continue with the values mentioned in the `page_size` field, page number `5` contains items 81 - 97.

{{site.data.var.ee}} returns an error if you specify a value that is greater than the number of available pages.

The following example sets the current page to 5:

```graphql
current_page: 5
```

## Interpret the results

The response to the `productSearch` query can contain details about each product returned as well as information about the ordering of the results.

### Facets

[Facets]({{ site.baseurl }}/live-search/facets.html) provide a method of high-performance filtering that uses multiple dimensions of attribute values as search criteria. Faceted search is similar, but considerably more advanced than the  native layered navigation functionality.

The `facets` object contains details about each facet that affects the search results. By default, Live Search provides static facets for the `categories` and `price` product attributes that are pinned to the top of the Filters list in the storefront. The merchant can also pin other attributes to this list.

Dynamic facets appear only when relevant, and the selection changes according to the products returned. In the storefront Filters list, dynamic facets appear in alphabetic order after any pinned facets. To streamline search results, facets are set to `dynamic` by default.

Intelligent dynamic facets measure the frequency that an attribute appears in the results list and its prevalence throughout the catalog. Live Search uses this information to determine the order of returned products. This makes it possible to return two types of dynamic facets: Those that are most significant, followed by those that are most popular.

The `buckets` sub-object divides the data into manageable groups. For the `price` and similar numeric attributes, each bucket defines a price range and counts the items within that price range. Meanwhile, the buckets associated with the `categories` attribute lists details about each category a product is a member of. The contents of dynamic facet buckets vary.

The following snippet returns all information about the applicable facets for a search:

```graphql
facets {
    attribute
    title
    type
    buckets {
        title
        ... on RangeBucket {
          title
          to
          from
          count
        }
        ... on ScalarBucket {
          title
          id
          count
        }
        ... on StatsBucket {
          title
          min
          max
        }
    }
}
```

### Items list

The `items` object primarily provides details about each item returned. If Catalog Service is not installed, then you must specify the `product` field to return details about each item. The `product` field uses the [`ProductInterface`]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.gdeurl }}/graphql/interfaces/product-interface.html), which is defined in {{site.data.var.ce}} and {{site.data.var.ee}}, to return details about the product. A typical query might return the product name, price, SKU and image.

The following snippet returns relevant information about each item when Catalog Service is not installed or used:

```graphql
items {
    product {
        name
        sku
        price_range {
          maximum_price {
            final_price {
              value
              currency
            }
          }
          minimum_price {
            final_price {
              value
              currency
            }
          }
        }
    }
}
```

If [Catalog Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/catalog-service/guide-overview.html) is installed, you can optionally use the `productView` field instead of the `product` field to return product details. Catalog Service uses [Catalog Sync](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/user-guides/catalog-sync.html) to manage product data, resulting in query responses with less latency than is possible with the `ProductInterface`. With Catalog Service, the structure of the pricing information varies, depending on whether the product is designated as a `SimpleProduct` (simple, downloadable, gift card) or as a `ComplexProduct` (configurable, grouped, or bundle).

The following Catalog Service snippet returns relevant information about each item:

```graphql
items {
  productView {
    name
    sku
    ... on SimpleProductView {
      price {
        final {
          amount {
            value
            currency
          }
        }
        regular {
          amount {
            value
            currency
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ... on ComplexProductView {
      options {
        id
        title
        required
        values {
          id
          title
        }
      }
      priceRange {
        maximum {
          final {
            amount {
              value
              currency
            }
          }
          regular {
            amount {
              value
              currency
            }
          }
        }
        minimum {
          final {
            amount {
              value
              currency
            }
          }
          regular {
            amount {
              value
              currency
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

{:.bs-callout-info}
The Catalog Service [products query](../catalog-service/products.md) describes the contents of the `ProductView` object.

The `items` object can also optionally return highlighted text that shows the matching search terms.

### Other fields and objects

The query response can also contain the following top-level fields and objects:

-  `page_info` - An object that lists the `page_size` and `current_page` input arguments as well as the total number of pages available.
-  `suggestions` - An array of strings that include the names of products and categories that exist in the catalog that are similar to the search query.
-  `total_count` - The number of products returned.

## Syntax

```graphql
productSearch(
    phrase: String!
    page_size: Int = 20
    current_page: Int = 1
    filter: [SearchClauseInput!]
    sort: [ProductSearchSortInput!]
): ProductSearchResponse!
```

## Required headers

You must specify the following HTTP headers to run this query. [GraphQL Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/live-search/graphql-support.html#headers-list) describes each of these headers.

-  `Magento-Environment-Id`
-  `Magento-Website-Code`
-  `Magento-Store-Code`
-  `Magento-Store-View-Code`
-  `X-Api-Key`

## Example usage

### Live Search

The following example uses "Watch" as the search phrase. The query uses the core `ProductInterface` to access product information. As a result, the query has a longer response time than using Catalog Service to retrieve this information.

For an example of using Live Search with Catalog Service, see [Catalog Service productSearch query]({{site.baseurl}}/catalog-service/productsearch.html). Other than returning the `productView` object, all other attributes are the same. See full references on this page.
