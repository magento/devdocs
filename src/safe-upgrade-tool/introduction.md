The Safe Upgrade Tool (SUT) is a command line (CLI) tool that checks a Magento instance against a specific version by analyzing all the non-Magento modules installed isn it.

The SUT identifies potential problems that must be fixed in your custom code before attempting to upgrade to a newer version of Magento.

The tool returns a list of errors and warnings that you must address before upgrading to a new version of Magento.

Refer to the [Install]({{ site.baseurl }}/safe-upgrade-tool/install.html).
