The Payment Services extension for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source can be installed with Composer keys, which are linked to the Magento ID ([mageid]({{ page.baseurl }}/marketplace/sellers/profile-personal.html#field-descriptions)) provided in the signup process. Composer uses these keys during the initial installation of {{site.data.var.ee}}, or in situations in which the Composer keys were not previously saved to the `auth.json` file.

See [Get your authentication keys]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.gdeurl }}/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html) for more information about obtaining Composer keys.

There are two ways to install this extension---for [{{site.data.var.ece}}](#magento-commerce-cloud) or [On-premises](#on-premises) installations. These methods require you to use the Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Update minimum-stability setting

Before installing the extension, you can change the `minimum-stability` requirement to `RC` (release candidate) in your `composer.json` file if you want to try the release candidate version. You can use an IDE or your favorite text editor (like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text).

In your `composer.json` file, change `"minimum-stability": "stable"` to `"minimum-stability": "RC"`.

{:.bs-callout-warning}
Changing the `minimum-stability` requirement to `RC` is only mandatory if it is a release candidate. The default value should be `"minimum-stability": "stable"`.

## Install the extension

You can install the Payment Services extension for both {{site.data.var.ece}} and on-premises instances.

### {{site.data.var.ece}}

This method is used for installing the Payment Services extension for a Commerce Cloud instance.

1. Update your `composer.json` file:

   ```bash
   composer require magento/payment-services --no-update
   ```

1. Update dependencies and install the extension:

   ```bash
   composer update
   ```

   The `composer update` command will update all dependencies. If you do not want to update all dependencies at the same time, use this command instead: `composer require magento/payment-services`.

1. Commit and push your changes.

### On-premises

This method is used for installing the Payment Services extension for an On-premises instance.

1. Run these commands to obtain the extension:

   ```bash
   composer require magento/payment-services --no-update
   ```

1. Update dependencies and install the extension:

   ```bash
   composer update
   ```

   The `composer update` command will update all dependencies. If you do not want to update all dependencies at the same time, use this command instead: `composer require magento/payment-services`.

1. Upgrade {{site.data.var.ee}}:

   ```bash
   bin/magento setup:upgrade
   ```

1. Clear the cache:

   ```bash
   bin/magento cache:clean
   ```

1. Commit changes.
1. Update your on-premises instance to ensure the committed code is deployed.

## Upgrade the extension

When we release a new version of Payment Services, you can easily upgrade your extension.

1. To obtain the most recent version of the package:

   ```bash
   composer update
   ```
   The `composer update` command will update all dependencies. If you do not want to update all dependencies at the same time, use this command instead: `composer update magento/payment-services`.

1. Commit and push your changes.

## Troubleshooting

You may see errors when attempting to install the Payment Services extension. Use the following troubleshooting methods to resolve the errors.

### Incorrect Composer keys

If you see the following error denoting you have the incorrect Composer keys:

```terminal
Could not find a matching version of package magento/payment-services. Check the package spelling, your version constraint and that the package is available in a stability which matches your minimum-stability (stable).
```

Verify that your Composer keys are linked to the Magento ID used during Payment Services registration.

To see which Composer keys are configured:

1. Find the location of the `auth.json` file:

   ```bash
   composer config --global home
   ```

1. View the `auth.json` file:

   ```bash
   cat /path/to/auth.json
   ```

1. See [which keys are associated with your Magento ID]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.gdeurl }}/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html).

### Not enough memory for PHP

If you see the following error denoting you do not have enough memory for PHP:

```terminal
Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 2146435072 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 4096 bytes) in phar:///usr/local/bin/composer/src/Composer/DependencyResolver/RuleWatchGraph.php on line 52
```

[Increase the memory limit]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/project/magento-app-php-ini.html#increase-php-memory-limit) for PHP on your environment in `php.ini`.

Alternatively, you can specify the memory limit using this command: `php -d memory_limit=-1 [path to composer]/composer require magento/payment-services`.

For example:

```bash
php -d memory_limit=-1 vendor/bin/composer require magento/payment-services
```
