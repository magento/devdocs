The Upgrade Compatibility Tool ALPHA is a command line tool that checks a Magento instance against a specific version by analyzing all the non-Magento modules installed in it.

The Upgrade Compatibility Tool identifies potential problems that must be fixed in your custom code before attempting to upgrade to a newer version of Magento.

The Upgrade Compatibility Tool returns a list of errors and warnings that you must address before upgrading to a new version of Magento.

It is distributed as a Composer package with every release of a Magento version. See [Developer]({{site.baseurl}}/upgrade-compatibility-tool/developer.html) topic for more information.

Refer to the [Install]({{site.baseurl}}/upgrade-compatibility-tool/install.html) for first steps with the Upgrade Compatibility Tool.
