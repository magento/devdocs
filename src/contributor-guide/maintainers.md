Magento trusts our active community members to review pull requests and accept or reject proposed code changes. [Community Maintainers](https://magento.com/magento-contributors#maintainers){:target="_blank"} take part in discussions, reviews, and help process pull requests.

## Who becomes a Maintainer?

When considering new maintainers, we look for contributors who have shown a propensity for:

-  Contributing good and accepted code to multiple Magento projects, including fixes for issues and new features
-  Participating in discussions in our development projects, including the [architecture](https://github.com/magento/architecture){:target="_blank"} and [backlog](https://github.com/magento/backlog){:target="_blank"} projects
-  Reviewing and discussing pull requests from other contributors
-  Helping other contributors with complex decisions and questions, like architecture questions, and providing advice according to [Magento technical guidelines]({{ site.gdeurl }}/coding-standards/technical-guidelines.html)

## Maintainer activities

Maintainers take part in these main activities:

-  Review pull request descriptions to make sure that they are meaningful and contain all required details; expedites pull request delivery without requiring additional clarification from contributors
-  Review pull requests according to [Magento technical guidelines]({{ site.gdeurl }}/coding-standards/technical-guidelines.html)
-  Avoid [backward incompatible changes]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributor-guide/backward-compatible-development/) in proposed changes
-  Make sure all new code is covered with appropriate unit, integration, and functional tests
-  Review issue descriptions to make sure that they are meaningful and provide clear reproduction steps
-  Participate in discussions regarding proposed solutions, created issues, and more
-  Help other community members resolve their questions and issues with advice, helpful code snippets, or other examples
-  Find and propose better or new methods for pull request reviews, code delivery, QA activities, tests, and more

## Guidelines for DevDocs

In general, the same [guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributor-guide/maintainers.html) for [`magento/magento2`](https://github.com/magento/magento2) maintainers apply to DevDocs maintainers. However, there are some [additional guidelines](https://github.com/magento/devdocs/blob/master/.github/MAINTAINER_GUIDELINES.md) that apply to DevDocs.
