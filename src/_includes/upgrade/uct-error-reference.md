## Errors

### Custom code

Custom code errors are raised when custom code is using the Adobe Commerce entry points that are not considered/marked as `@api`. The preserved behavior of such entry points is not guaranteed. The customization should rely on `@api` entry points instead. The functionality that is based on non-API Adobe Commerce code should be tested after the upgrade. These errors are also reported when major coding standards have been broken.
