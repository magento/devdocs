## Completely secure installation {#instgde-cli-fully-secure}

To use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), also referred to as HTTPS, for both the Magento Admin and the storefront, you must set all of the following parameters:

*  `--use-secure`: Set to `1`
*  `--base-url-secure`: Set to a secure URL (that is, starting with `https://`)
*  `--use-secure-admin` Set to `1`

More details about these parameters can be found later in this topic.
