Magento supports PHP 7.3.

{:.bs-callout-warning}
PHP 7.1 has reached [End of Life](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php). To maintain PCI compliance, Magento should not be run on unsupported software.
Installing from GitHub will no longer work with Magento 2.3.4/PHP 7.1.
The only way to install 2.3.4 with PHP 7.1.x is with Composer.
