If you want to add your own icons, each icon will need to be in its own SVG files. There are multiple ways to create icon fonts, here is one to get started:

1. Go to [https://icomoon.io/app/](https://icomoon.io/app/) or download this app in Chrome web store.

1. Upload your icons in SVG format into the app.

1. Specify desired font names and specify the Unicode characters to map the icons. Setting the icons to Private User Area will disable screen-readers or other accessibility tools to read your icon's characters (read "Unicode" section here).

1. Then initialize a download in the app to generate the icon font and [CSS](https://glossary.magento.com/css) style sheet.
