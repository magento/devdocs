This section discusses how to get a module's Composer name and its version from Magento Marketplace. Alternatively, you can find the name and version of *any* module (whether or not you purchased it on Marketplace) in the module's `composer.json` file. Open `composer.json` in a text editor and write down the values of `"name"` and `"version"`.
