To use pipeline deployment, we assume you are:

*  An experienced system integrator with excellent knowledge of Magento configuration options.
*  Managing a large Magento site (thousands of stock-keeping units (SKUs)) and want to keep production site downtime to a minimum.
*  Somewhat knowledgeable about PHP programming.
*  Experienced with source control methods.

   To use pipeline deployment, we assume your Magento code is in a source control repository. In this guide, we assume you're using Git but the choice of repositories is up to you.
