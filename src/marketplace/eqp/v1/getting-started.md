Follow these steps to get started using the **Marketplace EQP API**.

## 1. Create your user profile

-  Create your user profile on the [Marketplace Developer Portal][1] and/or [Sandbox Marketplace Developer Portal][2].
   -  See the Marketplace Developer Portal documentation on creating your [profile]({{ site.baseurl }}/marketplace/sellers/profile-information.html).
-  You do **not** need to immediately complete your profile.  However, before your submission can appear on the **Marketplace Store**, your profile must be completed.

## 2. Create your API access key

[API access keys](access-keys.html) describes this process.

## 3. Using your API access key, get a session token

-  See the section on [obtaining a session token](auth.html#session-token).

## 4. Using your session token, call one or more of the API endpoints

-  See the various endpoints in the [REST API](rest-api.html) section.
   -  For a specific example on how to use a session token, look at the bottom of the [authentication](auth.html#session-token-use) documentation.
