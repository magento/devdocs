Follow these steps to get started using the **Marketplace EQP API**.

## 1. Create your user profile

Create your user profile on the [Marketplace Developer Portal][1] and/or [Sandbox Marketplace Developer Portal][2]. See the Marketplace Developer Portal documentation on creating your [profile]({{ site.baseurl }}/marketplace/sellers/profile-information.html).

You do **not** need to immediately complete your profile.  However, before your submission can appear on the **Marketplace Store**, your profile must be completed.

## 2. Create your API access key

[API access keys](access-keys.html) describes this process.

## 3. Get a session token

Use your API access key to [obtain a session token](auth.html#session-token).

## 4. Call one or more of the API endpoints

Use your session token to call the Marketplace EQP API [endpoints](rest-api.html).
For a specific example on how to use a session token, look at the bottom of the [authentication](auth.html#token-use) documentation.
