---

The **Magento Marketplace Extension Quality Program ([EQP]({{ site.baseurl }}/marketplace/sellers/extension-quality-program.html)) REST API** provides access to the [Marketplace Developer Portal][1].

The **Marketplace Developer Portal** provides you the capability to do the following:

-  Publish your product's marketing information on the [Magento Marketplace][3]. As a result, your customers can find and purchase each of your products.
-  Publish your individual or company profile on the **Magento Marketplace**, making it easy for your customers to learn more about you and your company.
-  Upload your code for your Magento 2 extensions, themes, and shared packages to the **Magento Product Repository**. After your customers purchase your product,  your customers can download your code.
-  Access your sales reports. Get aggregated metrics on overall page views, category-specific page views, EQP process-related metrics and more.

## Where to use this API

There are two separate **Marketplace Developer Portal** environments where the Marketplace EQP API can be used:

-  Production - [https://developer.magento.com][1]
-  Sandbox - [https://developer-stg.magento.com][2]

Use your same login information for the production **Marketplace Developer Portal** to also log into the **Sandbox Marketplace Developer Portal**. Learn more about the [sandbox](sandbox.html) environment.
