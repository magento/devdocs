## Magento name

Magento <sup>®</sup> is a registered trademark, and must include the registration symbol the first time the name appears in your personal profile, company profile, product profile, or standalone document.

To insert the  registration symbol into HTML, place the cursor immediately after the Magento name, and enter either the numeric code for symbol name.

-  `&amp;#174;` -  Registration symbol numeric value
-  `&amp;reg;` -  Registration symbol name

Your use of the Magento name cannot suggest an affiliation with Magento. The Magento name can be referenced only as follows:

-  Correct -  “I create extensions for Magento.”
-  Incorrect -  “I create Magento extensions.” or “My Magento Extension...”

When referencing yourself or your company, use the _specializing in Magento_ phrasing.

-  The Magento logo must be half the size of your own branding, to avoid the suggestion of any affiliation.
