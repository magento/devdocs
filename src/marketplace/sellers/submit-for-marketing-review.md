title: Submit for Marketing Review
---

When you have completed the code, you can submit your extension for marketing review. You can submit your product for both technical and marketing review at the same time. The review process is the same for both extensions and themes.

Your extension is placed in a queue as soon as it is submitted. You will receive confirmation by email, and can track the status of your submission from your Marketplace account.

During marketing review, your submission is examined to ensure that it meets Marketplace requirements for presentation, content, and branding. Before granting approval, we read, review, and determine the quality of the marketing content for your extension according to our [marketing guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/marketplace/sellers/marketing-review-guidelines.html).

## Prepare for marketing review

Before submitting an extension or theme for marketing review, conduct your own internal review of the content to make sure that it is ready for publication.

-  Review the [marketing]({{ site.baseurl }}/marketplace/sellers/marketing-review-guidelines.html) guidelines to ensure that your extension meets Magento Marketplace and Magento development requirements.
-  Spell-check and review all text fields in your extension, product documentation, and marketing materials.
-  Read the text out loud to make sure that the tone is conversational, and with no missing or transposed words.
-  Get a second opinion. Ask a friend or colleague to review the profile, screenshots, and any supplemental documentation.
-  Consider the following: Is the presentation professional? Does it foster confidence in your skills as a developer? Does it have commercial appeal? Do you provide information to help customers understand your product and how it supports their storefronts and backend?
