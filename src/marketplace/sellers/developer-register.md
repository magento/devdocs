## Step 1: Create a developer account

1. Access your Magento account.

If you don’t yet have a Magento account, do one of the following:

-  Go to the [Magento Developer][1] page, and click <span class="btn">Create  Account</span>. Then, click <span class="btn">Register</span>.
-  In the upper-right corner of [Magento Marketplace][2], click **Sign In**. Then, click <span class="btn">Register</span>.
-  From [Magento.com][3], click **My Account**. Then under **New Customers**, click <span class="btn">Register</span>.

If you already have a Magento account, log in as a registered user.

1. Click **Marketplace** and choose **Developer Portal**.

1. Under _Personal Information_, enter your **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email Address**, and **Country**.

    {: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
    If there is already a Magento account with this email address, click the link to access your account.

1. Under _My Company Primarily_, choose the best description of your company’s primary focus. Then, set **My Role** to the option that best describes what you do for the company.

1. Under _Login Information_, enter a **Password** for your account. Then, enter it again to confirm.

    Your password can be from eight- to sixteen-characters long, and must include at least one capital letter, one number, and either one special character or one lowercase letter.

1. Select the **Terms of Service** checkbox and click  <span class="btn">Submit</span>.

## Step 2: Agree to the terms of service

Read the following documents that describe Magento Marketplace [terms of service][4].

-  Xcelerate & Marketplace Master Terms
-  Xcelerate & Marketplace Development Terms

For your reference, you can also find these documents on [Magento.com][4].

If you agree with the terms of use, select the checkbox and click <span class="btn">I Agree</span>.

## Step 3: Select the type of account

Your Magento Marketplace developer account can be set up as an individual or company. All extensions and themes that are developed by a single company should be managed under the same account.

When prompted, select the type of account you want to create, and click <span class="btn">Choose</span>. Then, follow the appropriate instructions to complete the profile for the account.
