---

After completing development, testing, and creating a new extension entry, you can submit your extension for [Technical]({% link marketplace/sellers/submit-for-technical-review.md %}) and [Marketing]({% link marketplace/sellers/submit-for-marketing-review.md %}) review. The extension enters a queue when submitted. We will review your extension code and submitted information according to the queue, sending feedback and confirmation by email. Track the status and progress of your extension submission through your Marketplace account. Our [Extension Quality Program]({% link marketplace/sellers/extension-quality-program.md %}) (EQP) verifies that all Marketplace extensions meet Magento quality standards and best practices.

Before submitting your extension for review, [complete the information]({% link marketplace/sellers/extension-information.md %}) about the extension through the [developer portal]({% link marketplace/sellers/developer-portal.md %}).

The extension submission process requires you to do the following:

-  Review and agree to the Terms and Conditions of Magento Marketplace.
-  Pass both technical and marketing review.
-  Provide information about your business to ensure that transactions and payments are processed efficiently. This information includes W-8 / W-9 forms, as required by law. For more information, see the [technical]({% link marketplace/sellers/technical-review-guidelines.md %}) and [marketing]({% link marketplace/sellers/marketing-review-guidelines.md %}) review guidelines.

You can submit your extension for [technical review]({% link marketplace/sellers/submit-for-technical-review.md %}) when you are ready to have Magento Marketplace review the code and technical aspects of your extension. These steps require additional information for your extension including a PDF guide, supported Magento versions, and code package.

You can submit your extension for [marketing review]({% link marketplace/sellers/submit-for-marketing-review.md %}) as soon as your marketing content is ready for review.

You must complete both the technical and marketing review to fully list your extension on the Magento Marketplace. The following diagram details the submission and review process.
