title: Marketing Review Guidelines
---

From a marketing perspective, all submissions to Magento Marketplace must solve a business problem and deliver rich and unique functionality. Marketing descriptions will be checked against our style guidelines to make sure that content is in line with Magento branding guidelines.

## Presentation: Make the first impression count

We have made an investment in the presentation of Magento Marketplace. In return, we ask that you put forth an effort to present your solutions in a professional manner. If we see room for improvement, we’ll reach out to you before listing your extension on Magento Marketplace.

-  Your product must have a professional presentation with clear descriptions, images, and screenshots.
-  The product name should indicate the purpose of the extension or theme.
-  The product description should be well-written, and provide an overview of the features and benefits.
-  Use only high-quality screenshots, images, and video to accompany the listing.

## Extension title

The extension title should fulfill the following guidelines:

* Choose a title that is descriptive and concise. The extension title can be up to five words long and must be in English.
* Do not include the version number, developer name, or any reference to Magento in the title.
    * Do not use _"Magento"_ or _"M2"_.
* Do not include the words _"Extension"_, _"Module"_ or _"Plugin"_.
    * However, the words, _"Connector"_ and _"Integration"_ can be used if applicable.
* Use _"&"_, instead of _"And"_. (_"Order & Save"_, not _"Order and Save"_)
* First letter of each word capitalized. (_"Mass Order Export"_, not _"Mass order export"_)
    * Do not use All Caps.
* No punctuation unless it’s part of the actual company name. (_"InstantSearch+"_, _"Yahoo!"_)
    * _"/"_ and _"-"_ are acceptable in certain circumstances. (_"Two-Factor"_, _"Import / Export"_)
* Not formatted like package name with underscores between words. (_"Extension_Title"_)
* No Developer Name in the title. (_"Print Order PDF"_, not _"Fooman Print Order PDF"_)
    * EXCEPTION: Integration. If the developer is the same name as the service being integrated. For instance, if Visa submits an integration, they SHOULD include _"Visa"_ since it’s the name of the service.
* Allowed to add Magento version _"(2.3)"_ if two separate extensions must be on the store.

## Extension icon

The extension icon should fulfill the following guidelines:

* The extension icon must reflect the extension with words and/or images.
  Text is not required, but an extension title can be added to the icon.
    * If the extension title added to the icon, it should exactly match the extension title.
    * No slogans or features.
* Do not use _"Magento"_ or _"M2"_.
* Do not use Magento Logo.
* Do not use the developer logo here instead of the extension icon.
* Do not specify the extension version.
* Limited use of _"Pro"_.
* Less is more. Tiny, intricate details are not easy to make out, try to avoid them.
* For the 1st party companies, we recommend using the same image, as you are using on Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.

## Long description

For guides and examples of long descriptions, see [Product Descriptions]({{ site.baseurl }}/marketplace/sellers/product-descriptions.html).

## User guide, reference manual or installation guide

Extension documentation should fulfill the following guidelines:

* Extension documentation must cover all features of the extension.
* Extension documentation must not direct users to make purchases on sites other than Marketplace.
* If an extension title added into documentation, it must not include _"Magento"_ in it. Use _"For Magento"_ after the title, if needed.
* Use of the Magento logo is prohibited. To learn more, see our [branding guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/marketplace/sellers/branding.html).
    * Partners can use their Magento partner badge.
* At least one piece of uploaded documentation must be in English
* Do not upload duplicates of the documents.
