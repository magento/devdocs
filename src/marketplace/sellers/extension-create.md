Before you can submit your extension to Magento Marketplace, the code must be complete, tested, and packaged. For technical information, see the Magento DevDocs for additional technical information for developing extensions and more:

Magento Marketplace does not support encrypted extensions at this time.

## Build your extension

1. Before submitting your extension review, see the [Technical Review Guidelines]({% link marketplace/sellers/technical-review-guidelines.md %}) and the [Marketing Review Guidelines]({% link marketplace/sellers/marketing-review-guidelines.md %}).

1. Use the [CodeSniffer][1] tool to verify that your code meets Marketplace guidelines.

   Testing your extension in advance reduces the time it takes to pass Technical Review. For a list of code sniffer rules, see [Magento Extension Quality Program Coding Standard][2].

1. Prepare, validate, and zip your extension as described in Packaging a Component for Magento version [2.x]({% link guides/v2.3/extension-dev-guide/package/package_module.md %}) or [1.x]({% link marketplace/sellers/packaging-v1x-extensions.md %}).

1. Prepare the following preliminary documentation:

   -  Release notes in text format
   -  A user guide, installation guide, or reference manual in PDF format
