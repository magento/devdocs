As the {{ site.data.var.ce }} and {{ site.data.var.ee }} technology moves forward, release lines get marked as End of Life (EOL) and deprecated.

We call extensions that are only compatible with deprecated (EOL) release lines "obsolete extensions".

Monthly automated checks are performed to identify extensions that only support EOL release lines and notify the developers that they are required to submit a version compatible with the latest release line.

There is a 30-day window to submit a compatible version; otherwise the extension is removed from the Marketplace.

If a compatible version is submitted through the Developer Portal and passes EQP tests and Marketing review, the listing is restored.

## Example notifications
