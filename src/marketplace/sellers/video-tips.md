Video is one of the most effective sales tools available. Demo videos use recorded sequences that are captured onscreen to give an overview of what the extension does, and how it is used. In addition, you can use instructional video to reduce support calls. You don't have to spend a lot of money to create great video that sparks interest and drives downloads.

-  Engage customers with a preview that illustrates your value proposition.
-  Demonstrate the capabilities of your extension.
-  Showcase the user experience.
-  Walk customers through the installation and configuration process.

Each extension can have up to three videos that are linked to the extension profile.

## Plan your presentation

Consider these tips as you plan the content structure and flow of your video.

-  Develop an outline or storyboard that highlights what makes your extension unique. Focus on the top three to five features from the extension description, and use them as a framework. If possible, include reviews from customers who have experience using your extension.
-  Make your final presentation from three to five minutes long. Plan the timing so you know how much time to spend on each feature.
-  Craft the messaging to explain any transitions or features that are related to the user interface.
-  Stage any demo content that you need to showcase your extension. Create dummy accounts for personal information.

## Produce the video

We recommend that you use a screen recording and editing tool to record and produce your video. Follow these tips to create a quality presentation that meets our guidelines:

### Content and format

Include only material that you have first obtained permission to use. If your extension makes use of protected content, make sure to obtain the appropriate licensing rights for your marketing use in all territories.

### Graphics and transitions

Add graphic elements, such as touch hotspots, only when necessary to demonstrate navigation and interactions.

### Text

Use concise onscreen text as necessary to give context to your presentation. Choose terms that are easy to understand, and appropriate for your target audience. Make sure that all text is legible, and remains on the screen long enough to be read.

### Audio

Most video editing tools manage audio in layers that are separate from the video. The layers make it possible to edit the video without disrupting the audio when one scene cuts to the next.
