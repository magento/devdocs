Amazon Sales Channel versions 4.0+ are only supported when integrated with Magento 2.3.x versions.

The Amazon Sales Channel extension installs and adds features to integrate your Magento catalog with Amazon Seller Accounts to sell through the Amazon Marketplace. To review additional information, see the [Amazon Sales Channel Marketplace](http://marketplace.magento.com/magento-module-amazon.html) page.

## Requirements

-  **Magento Instance**: Amazon Sales Channel can be installed on instances with {{site.data.var.ce}}, {{site.data.var.ee}}, and {{site.data.var.ece}} versions 2.3.x. We no longer support the extension on Magento 2.1, Magento 2.2, or Magento 1.
-  **Magento Web Account**: You should have a Magento web account, which is used to create and track an API key.
-  **API Key**: Get a Amazon Sales Channel API key through your Magento web account. The following instructions include these steps.
