-  {:.fix}Fixes and improvements
-  {:.bug}Known issues

### v3.0.1

Amazon Sales Channel 3.0.1 is compatible with versions 2.2.4+ and 2.3.x of {{site.data.var.ce}}, {{site.data.var.ee}}, and {{site.data.var.ece}}.

-  {:.fix}**Numerical Field Settings**: <!--CHAN-3779-->Fields that require a numeric-based value have been updated to only accept numeric characters. Example: Pricing Rule Settings > Adjustment Amount field

-  {:.fix}**User Guide Links**: <!--CHAN-3778-->Incorrect _User Guide_ links have been corrected.

-  {:.fix}**Duplicate Amazon Listings**: <!--CHAN-3593-->A previously reported issue causing duplicate Amazon listings has been corrected. Prior to this release, the extension added the Country Code for the Amazon region to SKU values when importing listings. The listing matched with the catalog item, but the extension created a new, duplicate listing with the appended SKU. With this release, the extension does not modify the SKU for imported listings, and no changes are made to existing listings. You can use the [End Listing(s) on Amazon](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/sales-channels/amazon/end-listings-manually.html) option to remove duplicate listings.

### v3.0.0

Amazon Sales Channel 3.0.0 is compatible with versions 2.2.4+ and 2.3.x of {{site.data.var.ce}}, {{site.data.var.ee}}, and {{site.data.var.ece}}.

-  {:.new}**Amazon UK Marketplace Now Available**: Users can choose the United Kingdom marketplace when [creating and integrating](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/sales-channels/amazon/store-integration.html) an Amazon Sales Channel store. This UK upgrade includes additional support for:

   -  [Amazon VAT Calculation Service](https://services.amazon.co.uk/vat-calculation-service.html)

   -  [Product Tax Code](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=G200794510&language=en_US) information.

-  {:.new}**Improved Logging**: <!--CHAN-3642, 3672-->Implemented the **Enable Debug Logging** feature to collect additional synchronization data when troubleshooting is needed. See the [Sales Channels Settings](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/configuration/sales-channels/global-settings.html) topic in the Configuration Reference.

-  {:.fix}**Product Catalog**: <!--CHAN-3687-->Corrected an issue preventing images imported with an Amazon listing from being applied to the corresponding Magento catalog product.

-  {:.fix}**Order Creation**: <!--CHAN-3708-->Corrected an issue preventing Magento from creating orders for an Amazon order that does not match with a Magento catalog product. See [Order Settings](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/sales-channels/amazon/order-settings.html).

-  {:.bug}**Duplicate Amazon Listings**: <!--CHAN-3593-->This issue causes the catalog to create a new item for an imported listing, using the same SKU but with a region code added on the end. Amazon then processes the modified SKU as a new item and creates a new listing. This issue will be addressed in an future release.

### v2.0.0

Amazon Sales Channel 2.0.0 is compatible with version 2.2.4+ and 2.3.x of {{site.data.var.ce}}, {{site.data.var.ee}}, and {{site.data.var.ece}}.
