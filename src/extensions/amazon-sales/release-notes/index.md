{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-warning}

-  {:.new}Introduced a simpler, streamlined [onboarding process](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/sales-channels/asc/amazon-onboarding-home.html) and [default store settings](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/sales-channels/asc/default-store-settings.html) to get your stores integrated faster.

-  {:.bug}<!--- CHAN-4102 --->When [creating attributes](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/sales-channels/asc/managing-attributes.html) for importing images from listings and **Store Views** is set to `All Store Views (Global)`, a known issue exists preventing images from importing to all store views.

### v3.0.1

The listing matched with the catalog item, but the extension created a new, duplicate listing with the appended SKU. With this release, the extension does not modify the SKU for imported listings, and no changes are made to existing listings. You can use the [End Listing(s) on Amazon](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/sales-channels/amazon/end-listings-manually.html) option to remove duplicate listings.

-  {:.new}**Improved Logging**: <!--CHAN-3642, 3672-->Implemented the **Enable Debug Logging** feature to collect additional synchronization data when troubleshooting is needed.

-  {:.bug}**Duplicate Amazon Listings**: <!--CHAN-3593-->This issue causes the catalog to create a new item for an imported listing, using the same SKU but with a region code added on the end. Amazon then processes the modified SKU as a new item and creates a new listing. This issue will be addressed in an future release.

Amazon Sales Channel 2.0.0 is compatible with version 2.2.4+ and 2.3.x of {{site.data.var.ce}}, {{site.data.var.ee}}, and {{site.data.var.ece}}.
