The Extension Quality Program is powered by Magento expertise, development guidelines, and verification tools to ensure that extensions have a logical and efficient coding structure, acceptable performance and scalability, and are compatible with the Magento core.

You can log in to your Marketplace account to check the status of your submission. If your submission does not pass our technical or marketing reviews, we will tell you why, and how to fix it. Otherwise, your successful submissions will be listed on the Marketplace.

## [Build Your Extension or Theme]({% link extension/marketplace/extension-create.md %})

When your extension code is complete, you can create the extension and version in Magento Marketplace.

## [Submit for Review]({% link extension/marketplace/submit-for-review.md %})

During Technical Review, your extension code is scanned and validated via automated testing and manual QA.

During Marketing Review, your extension marketing information (including the documentation and images) is examined for quality and to make sure that it meets our marketing guidelines.
If the extension doesn\'t pass either review, you can correct the problem and [resubmit]({% link extension/marketplace/extension-resubmit.md %}) it.

## [Approved for Marketplace]({% extension/marketplace/sales.md %})

When your extension passes Technical Review and Marketing Review, it is approved and released for publication on Magento Marketplace.
