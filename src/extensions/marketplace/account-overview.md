## Step 1: Log in or register for a developer account.

If you have an existing Magento account, simply log in and complete the [developer registration]({% link extensions/marketplace/developer-register.md %}) process. If you are new to Magento, you can sign up for a new account and register as a developer at the same time.

## Step 2: Agree to the terms of service.

Read the Magento Marketplace [terms of service](https://magento.com/legal/terms/marketplace-xcelerate). Then, select the checkbox to agree with the terms and continue.

## Step 3: Complete your personal profile.

The information in your [personal profile]({% link extensions/marketplace/developer-register.md %}) identifies you as an individual vendor in Magento Marketplace, and includes your background, image, contact information, and social network addresses.

## Step 4: Complete your company profile.

Your [company profile]({% link extensions/marketplace/develoepr-register.md %}) is similar to your personal profile, and provides the information about your company and brand that appears in your Magento Marketplace listing.
