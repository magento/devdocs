Vendor Bundled Extensions (VBEs) are third-party extensions that we have thoroughly tested and included with each supported version of {{site.data.var.ce}} and {{site.data.var.ee}}.

Current VBEs include:

-  [Amazon Pay](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/payment/amazon-pay.html)
-  [dotdigital](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/marketing/engagement-cloud.html) (formerly Dotmailer)
-  [Klarna](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/payment/klarna.html)
-  [Vertex](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/tax/vertex.html)
-  [Yotpo](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/marketing/yotpo-reviews-intro.html)

{:.bs-callout-info}
Installing or upgrading Magento also installs VBEs, but you may need to set up an account with a vendor to configure and use an extension.
