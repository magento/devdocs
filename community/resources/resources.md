This Community collection of resources links to blog posts, podcasts, presentations, and books created by members of the {% glossarytooltip cadefd6b-0e85-4a8c-909a-5f967c56d35f %}Magento{% endglossarytooltip %} community and core developers separated into popular topics.

New items will be added incrementally, and older links rotated out. Keep an eye on this space for the latest community resources!

Another community based resource, focused on describing the Magento 2 Environment is the [Magento 2 Awesome List][0]{:target="_blank"}

Do you know of a popular resource about Magento 2 that has been released/published within the past year?
