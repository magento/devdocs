  serves to provide a notification delivery platform for displaying new features of
  a Magento installation or upgrade as well as any other required release notifications.\n\n##
  Purpose and Content\n\n* Provides a method of notifying administrators of changes,
  features, and functionality being introduced in a Magento release.\n* Displays a
  modal containing a high level overview of the features included in the installed
  or upgraded release of Magento upon the initial login of each administrator into
  the Admin Panel for a given Magento version.\n* The modal is enabled with pagination
  functionality to allow for easy navigation between each modal page.\n* Each modal
  page includes detailed information about a highlighted feature of the Magento release
  or other notification.\n* Release Notification modal content is determined and provided
  by Magento Marketing.\n\n## Content Retrieval\n\nRelease notification content is
  maintained by Magento for each Magento version, edition, and locale. To retrieve
  the content, a response is returned from a request with the following parameters:\n\n*
  \ **version** = The Magento version that the client has installed (ex. 2.3.0).\n*
  \ **edition** = The Magento edition that the client has installed (ex. Community).\n*
  \ **locale** = The chosen locale of the admin user (ex. en_US).\n\nThe module will
  make three attempts to retrieve content for the parameters in the order listed:\n\n1.
  Version/Edition/Locale\n2. Version/Edition/en_US (default locale)\n3. Version (default
  file for a Magento version)\n\nIf there is no content to be retrieved after these
  requests, the release notification modal will not be displayed to the admin user.\n\n##
  Content Guidelines\n\nThe modal system in the ReleaseNotification module can have
  up to four modal pages. The admin user can navigate between pages using the \"<
  Prev\" and \"Next >\" buttons at the bottom of the modal. The last modal page will
  have a \"Done\" button that will close the modal and record that the admin user
  has seen the notification. \n\nEach modal page can have the following optional content:\n\n*
  Main Content\n    * Title\n    * URL to the image to be displayed alongside the
  title\n    * Text body\n    * Bullet point list\n* Sub Headings (highlighted overviews
  of the content to be detailed on subsequent modal pages) - one to three Sub Headings
  may be displayed\n    * Sub heading title\n    * URL to the image to be display
  before the sub heading title\n    * Sub heading content\n* Footer\n    * Footer
  content text\n\nThe Sub Heading section is ideally used on the first modal page
  as a way to describe one to three highlighted features that will be presented in
  greater detail on the following modal pages. It is recommended to use the Main Content
  -> Text Body and Bullet Point lists as the paragraph and list content displayed
  on a highlighted feature's detail modal page.\n\nA clickable link to internal or
  external content in any text field will be created by using the following format
  and opened in a new browser tab. Providing the URL for the link followed by the
  text to be displayed for that link in brackets will cause a clickable link to be
  created. The text between the brackets [text] will be the text that the clickable
  link shows.\n\n### Link Format Example:\n\nThe text: `https://devdocs.magento.com/
  [Magento DevDocs].` will appear as [Magento DevDocs](https://devdocs.magento.com/).\n"
