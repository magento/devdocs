  Magento\ScalableOms (Order Management System) module provides ability for system extension
  (Sales can be configured to work with separate database).
  Extraction of Sales tables to separate database will guarantee better scalability for Magento,
  and will allow main server to be optimised for read operations which will reduce latency.
