<!-- # IMPORTANT

We are no longer accepting pull requests to update v2.1 devdoc files.

Magento 2.1.18 is the final 2.1.x release. After the [June 2019 end-of-support date](https://magento.com/sites/default/files/magento-software-lifecycle-policy.pdf), Magento will no longer apply security patches, quality fixes, or documentation updates to v2.1.x. To maintain your site's performance, security, and PCI compliance, [upgrade](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/comp-mgr/bk-compman-upgrade-guide.html) to the latest version of Magento. -->
