### Firewall and SELinux {#firewall-selinux}

Please take into account that security-related software (iptables, SELinux, AppArmor etc.) may be configured by default to block communication between subsystems. It may be a good idea to check them in case of problems.

#### Set up rules for iptables and SELinux

To set up rules to allow communication with the firewall or SELinux enabled, consult the following resources:
