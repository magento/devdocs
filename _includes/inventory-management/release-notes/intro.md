*Release notes published January 2019.*

**{{site.data.var.im}} (provided by the [Multi Source Inventory (MSI)](https://github.com/magento-engcom/msi) project)** is now available with Magento 2.3.0. Merchants can use {{site.data.var.im}} to manage inventory for all product types in a single warehouse and across complex shipping networks. Merchants can manage these locations as sources, tracking on-hand inventory quantities per product. Stocks map these sources and sales channels (websites) to provide an accurate, salable quantity as inventory pools for concurrent checkout and product reservations. {{site.data.var.im}} also updates order and shipment options, giving you full control over your stock.

{{site.data.var.im}} is a Magento Community Engineering special project open to contributors. To take part and contribute, see the [MSI GitHub](https://github.com/magento-engcom/msi) repository and [wiki](https://github.com/magento-engcom/msi/wiki) to get started. Join us in our [Slack](https://magentocommeng.slack.com/messages/C5FU5E2HY) channel (or [self signup](https://tinyurl.com/engcom-slack)) to discuss the project.
