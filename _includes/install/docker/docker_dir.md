#### Local Project Path
When we build your Docker installation scripts, we need to know the path to your Magento installation relative to the directory in which your scripts are located. Because you must extract the scripts from a compressed archive, it might not be easy to specify a relative path.

The simplest option is to specify the absolute file system path to an existing Magento root directory, if any. If you haven't downloaded the Magento software yet, you can specify any value.
