Before you begin, make sure that:

1. Your system meets the requirements discussed in [Magento System Requirements]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/system-requirements.html)
1. You completed all prerequisite tasks discussed in [Prerequisites]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/prereq/prereq-overview.html).
1. After you log in to the Magento server, switch to a user that has permissions to write to the Magento file system. One way to do this is discussed in [switch to the Magento file system owner]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/prereq/file-sys-perms-over.html).
