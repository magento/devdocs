2.	You completed all prerequisite tasks discussed in <a href="{{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/prereq/prereq-overview.html">Prerequisites</a>.

<h3 id="instgde-install-web-enable-mod">Enabling and disabling modules</h3>
The Setup Wizard enables you to enable or disable modules before you install the Magento software. Before you do so, make sure you understand the following.

{% include install/enable-disable-modules.html %}

<h2 id="instgde-install-magento-web">Running the Setup Wizard</h2>
The Setup Wizard is a multi-page wizard that enables you to go back and forward one page at a time. You *cannot* skip pages, and you must enter all required information on every page before you can proceed to the next page.

In the event of errors, you can run the installer again or you can return to a previous page to fix errors on that page.

<h3 id="instgde-install-magento-web-step0">Getting started</h3>
To install the Magento software using the Setup Wizard:

1.	Start a web browser.

2.	Enter the following URL in the browser's address or location bar:

		http://<Magento host or IP>/<path to Magento root>/setup
	
	For example, if the Magento server's IP address is 192.0.2.10 and you installed Magento 2 in the <tt>magento2</tt> directory relative to the web server's docroot, and you did not configure a Virtual Host, enter:
	
		http://192.0.2.10/magento2/setup
	
3.	On the initial page, click **Agree and Set Up Magento**.

4.	Continue with the following topics in the order presented to complete the installation.
