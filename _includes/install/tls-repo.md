The Magento software and component repository, `repo.magento.com`, recently started requiring Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.1 or later.

The [PCI Security Standards Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Security_Standards_Council){:target="_blank"} removed SSL/TLS 1.0 as an example of strong cryptography from the [PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security){:target="_blank"} version 3.1, stating that it can no longer be used as a security control after June 30, 2016.  

For details, see [Date Change for Migrating from SSL and Early TLS](http://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/migrating-from-ssl-and-early-tls){:target="_blank"}. 

### Symptoms

If you have an earlier version of TLS, you'll see the errors discussed in this section.

#### Downloading a Magento metapackage

The following error displays if you attempt to run `composer create-project` to get a Magento metapackage:

	[Composer\Downloader\TransportException]
