This section discusses how to install sample data if you got the Magento software in any of the following ways:

*  Downloaded a compressed archive from [Magento](https://magento.com/tech-resources/download).

  If you downloaded an archive from GitHub, this method won't work because the `composer.json` file doesn't contain the `repo.magento.com` URL.
*  Used `composer create-project`

You can use this method of getting sample data for both {{site.data.var.ce}} or {{site.data.var.ee}}, but you must use the same [authentication keys]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html) you used to install Magento.

If you encounter errors, such as `Could not find package...` or `...no matching package found...`, make sure there arenâ€™t any typos in your command. If you still encounter errors, you may not have access to the right Composer repositories, especially if your using {{site.data.var.ee}}. Contact [Magento support](https://magento.com/support) for help.

You can use Composer to install sample data either before or after installing Magento; however, there might be [additional tasks]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/install/sample-data.html).

If you're a contributing developer, refer to [Install by cloning repositories]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/install/sample-data-after-clone.html).

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-warning}
Do not install sample data if your Magento application is set for [production mode]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/bootstrap/magento-modes.html#production-mode). Switch to [developer mode]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/bootstrap/magento-modes.html#developer-mode) first. Installing sample data in production mode [fails]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/trouble/tshoot_sample-data.html#trouble-samp-prod).

To install sample data using the command line, enter the following command as the Magento file system owner  in the `<magento_root>` folder:

```bash
bin/magento sampledata:deploy
```

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-warning}
If you're installing sample data _after_ installing Magento, you must also run the following command to update the database and schema in the `<magento_root>` folder:

```bash
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

You are required to [authenticate]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html) to complete the action.

## Authentication error

The following authentication error might display:

```terminal
[Composer\Downloader\TransportException]
The 'https://repo.magento.com/packages.json' URL required authentication.
You must be using the interactive console to authenticate
```

If the error displays, change to your Magento installation directory and run `composer update`, which will prompt you for your [authentication keys]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html).
