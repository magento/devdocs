<h2 id="instgde-prereq-sample-intro">Introduction to Magento sample data</h2>
Magento sample data provides a storefront based on the Luma theme outfitted with products, categories, customer registration, and so on. It functions just like a Magento storefront and you can manipulate prices, inventory, and promotional pricing rules using the Magento Admin.

You can install sample data either before or after installing the Magento software. When you're done with the sample data, you can either remove it or you can install it fresh as discussed in TBD.

You can install optional sample data in any of the following ways:

		<td><p>Run a command.</p></td>
		<td><p>You must be able to get to a command prompt on your Magento server but otherwise, this is the simplest way.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p>Using Composer</p></td>
		<td><p>Modify Magento's root <code>composer.json</code> to enable sample data modules.</p></td>
		<td><p>Requires Composer knowledge and access to the Magento file system.</p></td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p>Cloning repositories</p></td>
		<td><p>Clone the Magento 2 repository and the sample data repository, create symbolic links.</p></td>
		<td><p>For contributing developers only; in other words, developers who contribute to the Magento 2 codebase. Everyone else should use one of the preceding methods.</p></td>
