The following table discusses where to get the Magento software. We provide the following downloads:

*  Magento Open Source software only
*  Magento Open Source software with sample data (designed to help you learn Magento faster)

These packages are easy to get and install. You don't need to use Composer, all you need to do is to upload a package to your Magento server or hosted platform, unpack it, and run the web-based Setup Wizard.

Archives are available in the following formats: `.zip`, `.tar.bz2`, `.tar.gz`

To get the Magento Open Source software archive:

1. Go to [http://magento.com/download](http://magento.com/download){:target="_blank"}.
1. Choose either the software or the software and sample data:

   *  `Magento-CE-<version>.*` (without sample data)
   *  `Magento-CE-<version>+Samples.*` (with sample data)

   `<version>` is the three-digit release number (for example, `2.0.7`, `2.1.0`, and so on).
