After you pass all readiness checks, you can back up:

*  The Magento 2 file system (excluding `var` and `pub/static` directories)
*  The `pub/media` directory
*  The Magento 2 database

Backups are stored in the `var/backups` directory and can be restored at any time using the [`magento setup:rollback`]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-uninstall-mods.html#instgde-cli-uninst-mod-roll) or using the Magento Admin.
