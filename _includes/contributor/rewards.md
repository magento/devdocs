Magento is thankful for all contributions, and we always recognize our most active members. The aim is to find and recognize our top contributors according to points awarded during a given time period (monthly/quarterly/yearly). Contributors can earn points in numerous ways with a focus in pull requests to the backlog and special projects.

The Community Engineering team assesses each Pull Request and determines the best awards for the work involved. Contribution Points are calculated according to the assessment results. We award points when the PR is merged.

### How points are awarded
{:.no_toc}

Every merged PR receives one base achievement and potentially one or more additional achievements. These achievements are applied to PRs during review and assessment. Contributors and Maintainers receive points after the PR has been merged.

Due to the level of work required for developing and reviewing a PR, Contributors and Maintainers receive the same amount of points.

See the following examples for calculated reward points:

-  Contributor submits PR with complex code contributions: Improvement(base) 10 points + Complex(additional) 20 points = 30 points
-  Contributor submits PR with complex code and tests: Improvement(base) 10 points + Complex(additional) 20 points + Test coverage(additional) 10 points = 40 points
-  Contributor submits PR port of existing merged PR:
   -  Original contributor: (Improvement(base) 10 points + Complex(additional) 20 points) + Author of Ported Issue 5 points = 35 points
   -  Porting contributor: Port(base) 5 points
-  Maintainer reviews and approves PR with complex code and tests: Improvement(base) 10 points + Complex(additional) 20 points + Test coverage(additional) 10 points = 40 points

Earned achievements display as labels on GitHub PRs and for each Magento Contributor, Partner, and Maintainer on [magento.com](https://magento.com/magento-contributors).

## DevDocs awards and points

Contributors and Maintainers can also earn rewards for merged submissions to the [DevDocs repository](https://github.com/magento/devdocs). These earned points add to contributor totals. Like code contributions, the DevDocs team assesses the PRs and applies labels to determine the level of work and achievements. Each PR receives one base achievement and potentially additional achievements.

See the following examples for calculated reward points:

-  Contributor submits PR with HTML formatting and typos fixes: Editorial(base) 1 point
-  Contributor submits PR with code sample update and new parameter descriptions: Improvement(base) 10 points + Major update(additional) 20 points = 30 points
