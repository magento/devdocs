1. Access your account. You can open the email you received from Magento Cloud (accounts@magento.cloud) and click the _Access your project now_ link. Or you can log in to [your {{site.data.var.ee}} account](https://accounts.magento.cloud).
1. Click the _This project has no code yet_ link next to the Project name.

1. Enter a name for the project.

   ![Project name]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud_project_name.png)

1. Click **Create a blank site from a template** and click **Continue**. We recommend starting with the Magento template as your initial project option. If you have an existing Magento deployment, you can later import code, extensions, themes, and data after fully deploying this base Magento code.

1. When prompted, enter your {{site.data.var.ee}} [Magento authentication keys]({{ page.baseurl }}/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html) in the provided fields. You created these keys earlier in the Magento Marketplace. Enter the private and public keys and click **Finish**.

   ![Enter your authentication keys]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud-project-magento-auth-creds.png){:width="650px"}

   The keys are added to the `auth.json` file in the repository `master` branch, required for all created branches and deployments.

1. Wait a few minutes while the project deploys. A status of _Pending_ displays until completed, similar to the following:

   ![Your sample Magento project]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud_project_template2.png){:width="650px"}

1. After the project deploys, **Success** displays next to the name of your project.
