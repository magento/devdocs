**Updating your Pro project**: These sections include instructions for Pro projects with Staging and Production available in the Project Web Interface. To add Staging and Production to your interface, see [Add Staging and Production to Pro projects UI]({{page.baseurl}}/cloud/trouble/pro-env-management.html).

We can update Pro projects created before October 23, 2017. All new Pro projects include these features. Your ticket will be queued for update, which may take time to complete. We will keep you updated through the process.

If you do not request this update, you must use CLI commands or tickets to modify settings, variables, routes, and more for Pro plan Staging and Production environments.
