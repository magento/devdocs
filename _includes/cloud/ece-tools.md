The ece-tools package contains the following scripts and {{site.data.var.ece}} commands that automatically perform build and deploy actions of the codebase in your environments:

-   `php ./vendor/bin/m2-ece-build`
-   `php ./vendor/bin/m2-ece-deploy`

Versions are specified as `200<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.

These updates strictly contain improvements for tools, including build and deploy hooks. These tools are updated as needed through patching and product upgrades; managed by the `magento-cloud-metapackage`.
