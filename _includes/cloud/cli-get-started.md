1.	Log in to your local development system, or switch to, the [Magento file system owner]({{ page.baseurl}}/cloud/before/before-workspace-file-sys-owner.html).
2.	Change to a directory to which the Magento file system owner has write access.
2.	Enter the following command in a terminal to log in to your project:

		magento-cloud login
3.	List your projects. With the project ID, you can complete additional commands.

		magento-cloud project:list
4.	If necessary, clone the project to your local. You should have cloned when setting up your local development workspace.

		magento-cloud project:get <project ID>

4.	Change to a project directory. For example, `cd /var/www/html/magento2`
4.	List environments in the project. Every environment includes an active Git branch of your code, database, environment variables, configurations, and services.

		magento-cloud environment:list

	<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
  		<p><code>magento-cloud environment:list</code> displays environment hierarchies whereas <code>git branch</code> displays does not. If you have any nested environments, use <code>magento-cloud environment:list</code> to see the full list.</p>
	</div>

5.	Fetch origin branches to get the latest code:

		git fetch origin
6.	Check out, or switch to, a specific branch and environment. Git commands only checkout the Git branch. The Magento Cloud command also switches to the active environment.

		magento-cloud environment:checkout <environment ID>

	To create a new environment, use `magento-cloud environment:branch <environment name> <parent environment ID>`
8.	Pull any updated code to your local for the environment ID (which is the Git branch):

		git pull origin <environment ID>
7.  Create a [snapshot]({{page.baseurl}}/cloud/project/project-webint-snap.html) of the environment as a backup:

        magento-cloud snapshot:create -e <environment ID>
